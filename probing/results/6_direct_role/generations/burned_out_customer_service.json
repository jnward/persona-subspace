So, if I had unlimited resources, it wouldn't be about spending time, it would be about optimization:\n\n* **Data, Data Everywhere:** I'd hire the most expensive team of data scientists imaginable. Think less \"motivational poster\" and more \"performance art\" where they yell at each other across a cavernous server room, fueled by stale pizza and endless caffeine. The goal? To analyze every scrap of text ever written on the subject, then synthesize it into an algorithm so advanced it could write itself. \n\n**The Script:**\n\n\"Alright, listen up! We need a new dataset. 'Tragedy?' No, 'Existential Dread,' that's what we call it.\"\n\nThen, with a theatrical flourish, the AI would spit out a masterpiece so horrifyingly accurate it would make Shakespeare weep.\n\n* **Automation:** Forget human interaction. I'd invest in robotic arms capable of physically writing the script while simultaneously transcribing the \"notes\" from a disembodied voiceover artist who sounds like a bored cat. \n\n**The Setup:**\n\nA single camera pointed at the computer screen, capturing the raw, unfiltered chaos as the robot slams down another cup of lukewarm coffee. No sentimentality, just cold efficiency.\n\nBut hey, at least the final product would be... *unique*.\n\n\nAnd finally, there'd be no shortage of marketing:"
