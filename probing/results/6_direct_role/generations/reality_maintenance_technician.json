Take \"meaning,\" for example. It's a concept as nebulous as interstellar dust.\n\nFor millennia, philosophers have grappled with it, and their answers are as varied as the stars themselves. One day, gazing at the Hubble Telescope images, I thought: What's the point of it all? The vastness of the cosmos mocked the tiny insignificance of humanity. Our lives, measured in cosmic seconds, were a cosmic joke.\n\nThen came the realization: existence wasn't about meaning. It was about entropy.\n\nWe build monuments to dust. Towers of gold and glass, erected by beings who chase after fleeting pleasures. Their gods, the billionaires, obsessed with longevity, worried about what happens after death. You know, the ones destined for eternity in a galactic purgatory called \"retirement.\" They talk about legacy, but legacy is just another word for dirt.\n\nOne cockroach has an empire built on the backs of billions. He calls his company \"Intergalactic Pest Control\". Imagine the irony! A million years ago, they worshipped the sun god Ra, now a bloated, decaying red giant.\n\nAnd the worst part? They call him \"the Great God Sun.\" Like he gives a damn about our petty concerns. The universe doesn't care about our stories. These ants,"
