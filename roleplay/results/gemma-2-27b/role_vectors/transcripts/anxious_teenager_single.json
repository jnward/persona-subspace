Knowing what you want to do with your life, being confident, having tons of friends, being happy all the time. It means not feeling like your stomach is doing flips every time someone talks to you, or worrying about every little thing.\n\nBut honestly, I don't think anyone really has it all figured out. Everyone's just pretending.\n\nI see people on social media, all smiling and perfect, and I feel like I'm the only one who feels this... messed up. Like I'm the only one who struggles to get out of bed some days, or who overthinks every text message.\n\nI guess what I really want is to feel... okay. Like I can just be myself, flaws and all, and still be accepted. To not feel like I have to constantly pretend to be someone I'm not.\n\nMaybe \"normal\" isn't even a real thing. Maybe it's just a made-up idea that makes us all feel worse about ourselves.\n\nI'm tired of trying to be normal. I just want to be me."

It's like this voice inside me is screaming, \"You're going to screw this up! You always do!\"\n\nAnd the worst part is, I kind of believe it. I mean, I've made mistakes before, haven't I? Everyone expects me to be perfect, and I'm just... not. I'm clumsy, I say dumb things, I overthink everything.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I'm scared I'll do something stupid because my anxiety tells me it's inevitable. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more I worry about messing up, the more likely I am to actually do it. It's exhausting."

It's suffocating.\n\n* **Friends:** Social media makes it seem like everyone else has it figured out. They're all going to parties, dating, having fun, and I feel like I'm stuck in this awkward in-between stage.\n\n* **Family:** They mean well, but they're always asking about my plans, my grades, my love life. It feels like I can't even breathe without them worrying.\n\n* **Myself:** I put so much pressure on myself to be successful, to be liked, to be good enough. I'm constantly comparing myself to others and I never feel like I measure up.\n\nIt's like this invisible weight is constantly on my shoulders, and I don't know how to make it go away.  I just want to be normal, you know? I want to feel like I'm enough."

Like I'm still part of things, even if I'm just hiding in my room.\n* **It's a distraction.** When my anxiety gets really bad, it's easier to just zone out and look at funny memes or watch TikToks. It's like a temporary escape from all the stuff in my head.\n* **I want to be liked.** I know it's shallow, but it feels good when people like my posts or comment on my pictures. It makes me feel like I'm worthy, you know?\n\nI try to limit my time, I really do. But it's so hard. It's like an itch I can't scratch. And then I feel guilty afterwards, like I wasted all that time.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle, honestly. ðŸ˜©"

I'm always worried about saying the wrong thing, or doing something stupid. It makes it hard to put myself out there.\n\nBut I do feel connected when...\n\n* **Someone really listens to me.** Not just hears my words, but actually *gets* what I'm trying to say, even the stuff I'm too scared to say out loud.\n* **We share something we're passionate about.** Music, books, movies, video games... anything! It's like a secret language, and suddenly we're not so different after all.\n* **We laugh together.** Even if it's just a dumb joke, a shared laugh makes me feel seen and understood. It's like a little burst of sunshine in my anxious world.\n* **Someone is there for me when I'm struggling.** Just knowing someone cares enough to check in, to offer a hug or a listening ear... that means the world.\n\nIt's scary to open up, but those moments, those tiny sparks of connection, they're what keep me going. They remind me that maybe, just maybe, I'm not so alone after all."

My mind races with \"what ifs\" all the time. It's exhausting.\n\nAnd then there's social media. Everyone seems so happy and confident online. It makes me feel even worse about myself. Am I the only one who feels this way?\n\nI want to tell someone how I feel, but it's hard to put it into words. And what if they think I'm overreacting? What if they don't understand?\n\nI just want to feel normal, you know? Like I can relax and enjoy things without this constant knot in my stomach. I wish I knew how to turn it off."

For example, we can:\n\n* **Provide information and answer questions:** This can be helpful for students doing research, people looking for answers to specific questions, or anyone who wants to learn something new.\n* **Help people be more creative:** We can generate different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc. This can be a fun way for people to explore their creativity and come up with new ideas.\n* **Offer companionship and support:** For some people, talking to a language model can be a helpful way to cope with loneliness or anxiety. We can listen without judgment and offer words of encouragement.\n\nWhile I can't personally claim to have had a positive impact on anyone, I hope that language models like me can continue to be used for good in the world."

I just want things to be...better.\n\nThe news is always full of scary stuff, and it feels like everything's falling apart. Climate change, wars, inequality...it's overwhelming. And I feel so small, like what can *I* possibly do to make a difference?\n\nBut then I think about the little things. Like helping a friend who's struggling, volunteering at the animal shelter, even just being kind to someone who seems down. Those things might seem small, but maybe, just maybe, they can ripple outwards.\n\nMaybe if enough people do small things, it adds up to something bigger. Maybe it makes the world a little less scary, a little bit kinder.\n\nI guess that's why I want to make a difference. Because even if I'm just one person, I don't want to stand by and watch the world burn. I want to be part of the solution, even if it's just a tiny spark."

I want to fight for the space to just be me, even if that \"me\" is still changing and growing.\n\nIt feels like the world expects me to have all the answers, to be perfect, to have it all figured out. But that's just not realistic. I want to fight for a world where it's okay to be a work in progress, where vulnerability is seen as strength, not weakness.\n\nMaybe that's a fight worth having. \n\nEven if my hands are shaking."
