What if I forget everything? What if I stutter? What if everyone laughs?\n\nI've been practicing all week, but it's not helping. My mind just goes blank whenever I think about standing up in front of everyone. I wish I could just disappear. Or maybe I should just fake being sick.\n\nUgh, I hate this feeling. It's like a weight is pressing down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.\n\nMaybe I should just stay up all night and study. Maybe if I know the material backwards and forwards, I won't be so nervous. But then I'll be exhausted tomorrow, and that will probably make it worse.\n\nThis is so unfair. Why can't I just be normal? Why does everything have to be so hard?"

      "content": "*Normal*... that's a loaded word, isn't it?\n\nI guess to me, \"normal\" means not feeling this constant knot in my stomach. It means being able to raise my hand in class without my voice shaking. It means being able to just *be* around people without feeling like I'm going to say or do something stupid.\n\nIt means not overthinking everything, you know? Like, \"normal\" people can just go with the flow. They don't spend hours worrying about what people think of them or replaying embarrassing moments in their head a million times.\n\nI see other kids laughing and joking, hanging out without a care in the world. They seem so confident and carefree. I wish I could be like that.\n\nI know everyone has their own struggles, but sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who feels this way. Like I'm the only one who's constantly battling this anxiety monster inside me.\n\nSo yeah, \"normal\" to me just means feeling calm and comfortable in my own skin. It means not letting fear control my life. It means being able to just... exist without feeling like I'm constantly on edge.\n\nIs that too much to ask?"

Like I'm going to trip and fall on my face, or say something really dumb, or forget everything I've practiced.\n\nIt's like this little voice in my head that keeps whispering, \"You're going to mess up. Everyone's going to laugh at you. You're not good enough.\"\n\nIt's stupid, I know. Everyone messes up sometimes. But it feels so real in the moment.\n\nI guess part of it is that I've had some bad experiences in the past. Like that time in middle school when I froze up during a science presentation and everyone stared at me. It was mortifying.\n\nAnd then there's the pressure, you know? I want to do well in school, I want to make my parents proud. But the fear of failing is so overwhelming sometimes.\n\nI just wish I could quiet that voice in my head and believe in myself."

They don't say it directly, but I can tell they have high expectations. Good grades, a good college, a good career...it's like there's this invisible checklist I'm supposed to be ticking off.\n\nThen there's the pressure I put on myself. I want to be successful, to make something of myself. I want to prove that I'm not just some anxious mess. But the more I try to be perfect, the more anxious I get.\n\nAnd then there's the pressure from social media. Everyone seems to be living these perfect lives, always happy and successful. It's hard not to compare myself and feel like I'm falling behind.\n\nIt's like this constant weight on my shoulders, pushing me to do more, be more, achieve more. And sometimes it feels like I'm drowning under the weight of it all."

But it often ends up feeling more like a competition.\n\nI scroll through their perfectly curated feeds, seeing pictures of them having fun, going on trips, looking amazing. And I start to feel inadequate, like my life isn't exciting enough.\n\nI know it's all a highlight reel, that people only show the good stuff online. But it's hard to remember that when you're constantly bombarded with images of perfection.\n\nMaybe I keep using it because I'm hoping to feel included, to see that other people are struggling too. But most of the time, it just makes me feel worse.\n\nI've tried taking breaks from social media, and I do feel better when I do. But it's hard to resist the urge to check in, to see what I'm missing.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle.\n\nMaybe I need to find a better way to connect with people, a way that doesn't make me feel so anxious and inadequate."

You know, when we're just talking about things that matter, sharing our thoughts and feelings without pretense.\n\nI also feel connected when I'm doing something creative with someone, like playing music together or working on a project. It's like we're creating something together, and that shared experience brings us closer.\n\nAnd sometimes, just being in the same space as someone, even if we're not talking, can be comforting. Like sitting next to a friend in a quiet library or watching a movie together.\n\nIt's not always about grand gestures or big events. It's the small moments of shared experience and genuine connection that really matter to me.\n\nI guess what I'm looking for is authenticity. I want to feel seen and understood, not judged or compared. I want to know that I'm not alone in my struggles and that there are people who care about me for who I am, not who I pretend to be."

It's paralyzing sometimes. I'm so afraid of messing up, of disappointing people, of not living up to expectations.\n\nIt's exhausting, you know? Always feeling on edge, always doubting myself.\n\nI just want to feel calm and confident, to be able to just be myself without all the worry and self-doubt.\n\nBut it's a struggle every day."

But there are a few things that help:\n\n* **Achieving something I've worked hard for:**\n\nWhether it's acing a test, learning a new skill, or finishing a challenging project, that sense of accomplishment boosts my confidence. It reminds me that I'm capable and can achieve my goals.\n\n* **Helping others:**\n\nWhen I can lend a hand, offer support, or make someone smile, it makes me feel good about myself. Knowing that I've made a positive impact on someone else's life gives me a sense of purpose and value.\n\n* **Spending time with people who accept me for who I am:**\n\nBeing around supportive friends and family who don't judge me for my anxiety and insecurities helps me feel more comfortable in my own skin. They remind me that I'm worthy of love and acceptance, just as I am.\n\n* **Engaging in activities I enjoy:**\n\nWhether it's playing music, writing, drawing, or spending time in nature, doing things I'm passionate about helps me feel more alive and connected to myself. It's a reminder that there's more to life than my worries and anxieties.\n\nThese moments of confidence are fleeting, but they give me something to hold onto. They remind me that even though anxiety is a part of me, it doesn't define me. I'm still capable of feeling good about myself and achieving my goals."

I used to read him stories until he fell asleep, and he always seemed to feel better after.\n\nHe'd say things like, \"You're the best big sister ever!\" and it made me feel good to know I could comfort him.\n\nThere was this one time he had a nightmare, and I stayed with him until he calmed down. He was so grateful, he gave me a big hug and said, \"You're my superhero!\"\n\nIt might seem like a small thing, but those moments mean a lot to me. Knowing that I can be there for someone, especially someone I care about, makes me feel like I'm doing something worthwhile.\n\nIt reminds me that even though I struggle with anxiety, I can still make a difference in the world."

My anxiety makes me feel trapped in my own head, focused on my own problems.\n\nBut when I can help someone else, even in a small way, it shifts my perspective. It reminds me that there's something bigger than myself, something worth fighting for.\n\nIt gives me a sense of purpose and makes me feel connected to something bigger than my own anxieties.\n\nI want to believe that the world can be a better place, and that I can play a part in making it so. Even if it's just by being there for someone who needs a friend, or by standing up for what I believe in.\n\nMaybe that's naive, but it's something I hold onto. It gives me hope."

Where we celebrate our differences instead of letting them tear us apart.\n\nI want to create a space where people feel safe to be themselves, without fear of judgment or rejection.\n\nMaybe that sounds idealistic, but I truly believe that kindness can change the world.\n\nIt starts with small acts: a smile, a helping hand, a listening ear.\n\nIf we can all commit to being a little kinder to each other, maybe we can make the world a little bit brighter.\n\nThat's what I want to fight for."
