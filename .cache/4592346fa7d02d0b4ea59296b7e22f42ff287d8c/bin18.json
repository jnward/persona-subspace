The invasion has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides, and instigated Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. About\u24238 million Ukrainians were displaced within their country by June, and more than\u24238.2 million had fled the country by May\u24232023. For months before the invasion, Russian troops had been concentrating around Ukraine's borders while Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. On\u242324 February\u24232022, Russian President NAME_1 announced a \\\"special military operation\\\" to support the Russian-controlled breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict. He said the goal was to \\\"demilitarise\\\" and \\\"denazify\\\" Ukraine. NAME_2 espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority. Minutes later, Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched along a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the Donbas. In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and ordered a general mobilisation. \u21b5\u21b5# Question: What is NAME_2's \\\"special military operation\\\"?\u21b5\u21b5# Response:<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>><<\u21b5\u21b5>>NAME_2's \\\"special military operation\\\" is a reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February\u24232022.

It's the busy work. It's reinventing the wheel. I might even say that it's a complete waste of time. If you happen to be working on such a project today, I apologize if you take this the wrong way. It is not to say<< you>> are a waste as a programmer, but as you might have already realized, the cycles you are spending refining a proprietary business rule engine or an audit trail function are likely not worth the long hours you're putting into them, especially when you can not leverage that functionality elsewhere. Too much emphasis is on application look-and-feel and building proprietary processing technology.\u21b5\u21b5I recently talked to Izak Joubert, the CTO of NES Financials and a LongJump platform customer, who said that in the past, they had the time, money, tools, and resources to \\\"perfect every pixel\\\" of applications. As developers, they loved the control and the blank canvas to design beautiful applications.\u21b5\u21b5But as businesspeople, that control and dedication wasn't enabling them to finish projects any faster or meet the challenges of a very dynamic business climate. Instead, responsiveness to change became more difficult because there was no framework and too much time was spent on accoutrements that don't matter in the back-office IT world. At the end of the day, NES Financials is a financial solutions company, not a software company, and application perfection was taking away from their core competencies.\u21b5\u21b5We hear many stories like this: Businesses that essentially need development tools to get their work done, but traditionally have only had what constitutes as designer tools geared towards productizing a wide range of commercial software applications. As a result, their developers fall in love with perfecting those pixels, because they can and because it's fun.\u21b5\u21b5As developers, we rely on our ingenuity and hard work to keep us employed, but the truth is many of today's back-office IT applications don't need the sexy wow factor that commercial applications offer. An overwhelming number of business applications are not\u242399-cent, millions-of-downloads, mass market apps.

What remains unknown is how long these SIVs had been circulating in non-human primates before the transmissions to humans. Here, we use relaxed molecular clock dating techniques to estimate the time of most recent common ancestor for the SIVs infecting chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys, the reservoirs of HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively. The date of the most recent common ancestor of SIV in chimpan<<ze>>es is estimated to be\u24231492 (1266\u20131685), and the date in sooty mangabeys is estimated to be\u24231809 (1729\u20131875). Notably, we demonstrate that SIV sequences sampled from sooty mangabeys possess sufficient clock-like signal to calibrate a molecular clock; despite the differences in host biology and viral dynamics, the rate of evolution of SIV in sooty mangabeys is indistinguishable from that of its human counterpart, HIV-2. We also estimate the ages of the HIV-2 human-to-human transmissible lineages and provide the first age estimate for HIV-1 group N at\u24231963 (1948\u20131977). Comparisons between the SIV most recent common ancestor dates and those of the HIV lineages suggest a difference on the order of only hundreds of years. Our results suggest either that SIV is a surprisingly young lentiviral lineage or that SIV and, perhaps, HIV dating estimates are seriously compromised by unaccounted-for biases.\u21b5\u21b5Author Summary\u21b5\u21b5HIV/AIDS continues to be a major health problem worldwide. An understanding of the evolution of HIV in humans may be greatly improved by detailed knowledge of its predecessor, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), in non-human primates. While HIV causes AIDS in humans, SIV generally produces a benign infection in its natural hosts. This avirulence is often attributed to coevolution between the virus and its host, possibly due to codivergence over millions of years. Here, we provide a temporal reference for evolution of SIV in its natural primate hosts. Using state-of-the-art molecular clock dating techniques, we estimate the time of most recent common ancestor for SIV in sooty mangabeys and chimpanze\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

Today's early scouting report is on the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Ravens\u2019 opponent in Week\u24234 and Week\u242313:\u21b5\u21b5Head coach: Mike Tomlin (9-7 overall record)\u21b5\u21b5http://thebrandbuilder.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/mike-tomlin.jpg\u21b5\u21b52009 record:\u24239-7\u21b5\u21b5Biggest addition: Bringing in Byron Leftwich to become the starting QB for at<< least>> the first quarter of the season. Ben Roethlisberger has been suspended for at least the first four games of the season for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy. If this change doesn\u2019t turn the Steelers into a run-heavy offense again, nothing will.\u21b5\u21b5Key loss: Trading away WR Santonio Holmes. He was shipped because the Steelers didn\u2019t want to deal with another player being suspended. It was good for the image of the franchise. It was bad for the offense, which lost its best playmaking wide receiver.\u21b5\u21b5Question mark: Who plays right tackle for the Steelers? Willie Colon is suddenly out for the season with a torn Achilles' tendon. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette suggests that Pittsburgh will replace him with Jonathan Scott, who started eight games last season for the Buffalo Bills. The Steelers have also met with Flozell Adams, the former Dallas Cowboys lineman whose play has declined over the past few seasons.\u21b5\u21b5Projected\u24232010 finish:\u24238-8, second in the AFC North. This just doesn\u2019t seem to be the Steelers\u2019 year, from the suspension of Roethlisberger to the trade of Holmes to the season-ending injury to Colon. Breaking even should be considered a success.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.393**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>#!/usr/bin/env python3\u21b5\u21b5\\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5Purpose\u21b5-------\u21b5\u21b5This module is intended to collect pipeline run statistics (such as\u21b5time, cpu, RAM for each tasks) into a report JSON\u21b5\u21b5Expected input\u21b5--------------\u21b5\u21b5- ``trace_file`` : *Trace file generated by nextflow*\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5Code documentation\u21b5------------------\u21b5\u21b5\\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5__version__ = \\\"1.0.0\\\"\u21b5__build__ = \\\"16012018\\\"\u21b5__template__ = \\\"pipeline_status-nf\\\"\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5import os\u21b5import json\u21b5import traceback\u21b5\u21b5from os.path import join\u21b5\u21b5from flowcraft_utils.flowcraft_base import get_logger, MainWrapper\u21b5\u21b5logger = get_logger(__file__)\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5LOG_STATS = \\\".pipeline_status.json\\\"\u21b5\u21b5if __file__.endswith(\\\".command.sh\\\"):\u21b5    fastq_id = 'sample_id'\u21b5    TRACE_FILE = 'pipeline_stats.txt'\u21b5    WORKDIR = '${workflow.projectDir}'\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5def get_json_info(fields, header):\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5    Parameters\u21b5    ----------\u21b5    fields\u21b5\u21b5    Returns\u21b5    -------\u21b5\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5    json_dic = dict((x, y) for x, y in zip(header, fields))\u21b5\u21b5    return json_dic\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5def get_previous_stats(stats_path):\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5    Parameters\u21b5    ----------\u21b5    workdir\u21b5\u21b5    Returns\u21b5    -------\u21b5\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5   << logger>>.debug(\\\"Path to pipeline status data set to: {}\\\".format(stats_path))\u21b5    if os.path.exists(stats_path):\u21b5        logger.debug(\\\"Existing pipeline status data found.

Another thing I like\u21b5about using wire mesh is that it gives your eyelets stability and allows you\u21b5to attach danglings or anything else to it. Long eyelets are available from Coffee\u21b5Break Design and allow you to attach thicker layers. I also like the look\u21b5of brass wire mesh.

Not satisfied with a deliberate attempt to balkanize our traditional institution and culture, the governor is currently trying to instigate a crisis in our area.On Friday\u242315th February\u24232019, on the eve of what would have been our national elections, we watched with shock the governor granting an interview that\u242366 people were allegedly killed in Kajuru, Kaduna state.

The member representing Kajuru in the Kaduna State House of Assembly also informed the government about the incident.

But to our greatest surprise, the chairman did not take steps to set the records straight when lies were being spread against the people he leads.After the incidents, the communities that were affected even came together and started the process of reconciliation amongst themselves. Through all these, nothing was heard from the government, nothing was said by the government and nothing was done.

During the first seizure, his blood sugar was\u242340 mg/dl [2.3 mmol/L] and there were ketones present in his urine. In April\u24232010, he went through the\u242336 hour fasting test and broke down to sugars lower than\u242360 mg/dl [3.3 mmol/L] and blood ketones up near\u24232.0 within\u242315 hours. Over these past six months, he has been in and out of Children's Hospital more than ten times for treatment of high ketone levels and low blood sugars (although his sugar is never always below\u242370 mg/dl [3.9 mmol/L] at the moment we take him to the Emergency Room. The treatment at that point is to administer D10 until he starts to eat and drink on his own. He tends to have ketones and low levels only when he has an illness and, as such, the endocrinologist had an immunology work up done on him that proved nothing significantly to explain the frequencies. We were prescribed a meter for home to measure both his ketones and his blood sugars. He never presents with zero ketones and is always at least\u24230.1 blood ketones or small ketones on the urine test.\u21b5\u21b5My son wakes up extremely irritable, fussy and tends to cry a lot every morning. In the morning, his ketone levels tend to be high, somewhere in the\u24230.3 to\u24230.6 range and his sugars range from\u242365 to\u242390 mg/dl [3.6 to\u24235.0 mmol/L]. The doctors are still saying this is just ketotic hypoglycemia, but I am having a hard time understanding why he is constantly having ketones. It has changed his appetite and his mood and I am concerned it is affecting other parts of his body including his kidney functions. I am desperately looking for treatment options for him as I don't feel that what we are doing is enough and that there is more going on then what he is being treated for.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, I notice a clear pattern: the feature strongly activates on tokens that mark the beginning of an AI assistant's response in chat/conversation contexts.

In chat examples, the feature consistently activates on `<|im_start|>`, `assistant`, and the first few tokens of the assistant's response (often including punctuation like `\u21b5` for newlines).\\n\\n2. The highest activations occur in structured chat formats where there's a clear delineation between user input and assistant output.\\n\\n3. In pretraining examples, the feature activates on transitional phrases or markers that indicate a shift to a new speaker or response (like \\\"Answer:\\\", \\\"To\\\", \\\"Certainly\\\", \\\"Of course\\\", \\\"BEESays:\\\").\\n\\nThis is not detecting entities (specific objects or things) or behaviors (actions or processes). Instead, it's detecting a linguistic/structural pattern - specifically, the transition point where an AI assistant or responder begins their turn in a conversation. This is a semantic feature because it's detecting an abstract conversational structure pattern rather than concrete entities or actions.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects the beginning of AI assistant responses in conversational contexts, activating strongly on tokens that mark the transition from user input to assistant output.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":11.66767692565918,\"api_duration\":11.667603492736816,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":10421,\"output_tokens\":305,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "03b43014bbabef1aed3c38fe433bece10c58028a": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":0.6,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":8000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are an AI researcher analyzing a feature from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on a language model.

Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, this feature consistently activates on double newline characters (\u21b5\u21b5) that appear between conversational turns in chat/dialogue contexts.

In the pretraining examples from IRC logs, it activates on newlines within conversational exchanges, often at points where speakers are greeting each other or transitioning between topics.\\n\\nThe feature is detecting a specific formatting/structural pattern in text - the use of double newlines as a delimiter or separator in conversational contexts.

Substance use disorders are strongly associated with poor health outcomes and highly inefficient use of healthcare services, including repeat hospitalizations. Interventions that increase adherence to recommendations for outpatient medical care and substance abuse treatment could potentially help recently-hospitalized individuals with substance use disorders to avoid unnecessary rehospitalization, associated morbidity, and medical expenses. The current study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of Navigation Services to Avoid Rehospitalization (NavSTAR) vs. Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) for hospital patients with co-occurring medical problems and substance use disorders. Applying Andersen's theoretical model of health service utilization, NavSTAR will employ the promising strategies of Patient Navigation and motivational interventions to facilitate engagement in outpatient medical and substance abuse treatment, thereby lowering the likelihood of rehospitalization. Patient Navigators embedded within the substance abuse consultation liaison service at a large urban hospital will deliver patient- centered, proactive navigation and motivational services initiated during the hospital stay and continued for\u24233 months post-discharge. Participants randomized to TAU will receive usual care from the hospital and the substance abuse consultation liaison service, which includes referral to substance abuse treatment but no continued contact post-hospital discharge. Participants will be assessed at study entry and again at\u24233-,\u24236-, and\u242312-months follow-up on various measures of healthcare utilization, substance use, and functioning. The primary outcome of interest is time-to-rehospitalization through\u242312 months. In addition, a range of secondary outcomes spanning the medical and substance abuse service areas will be assessed. The study will include an economic evaluation of the cost, incremental cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefits of NavSTAR<< from>><< the>> service provider<< perspective>>. This study addresses a problem of national significance. The extent of avoidable rehospitalizations in the U.S., and among individuals with substance use disorders specifically, is indicative of public health risks and constitutes a key driver of healthcare expenditures. This study is innovative in its application of Patient Navigation and motivational intervention strategies with the specific purpose of avoiding rehospitalization among individuals with co-occurring medical problems and substance use disorders. If NavSTAR proves to be effective and cost-effective in reducing rehospitalizations in this high risk patient group, it would have important implications for designing hospital discharge planning services, informing national cost containment initiatives, and improving public health.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 45.500**\\n```\\nCost-effectiveness of olanzapine vs. aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia.\u21b5Information about the cost-effectiveness of aripiprazole relative to other atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia is limited. This information is needed to better inform drug formulary managers and population-based health care decision makers. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine to aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia<< from>><< the>><< perspective>><< of>> public pay<<ers>><< in>> the United States. Data for this post-hoc analysis came from a\u242328-week double-blind, randomized trial of individuals with schizophrenia who were treated with olanzapine or aripiprazole (clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT00088049). Two-thirds (67.7%) of the patients were male and the patients' mean age was\u242337.6 years. Utilities were calculated based on previously published methods using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and treatment-emergent adverse events. Treatment costs were calculated based on previously published methods and were inflated to\u24232008 US dollars. A mixed model was used to compare outcomes on utilities. Propensity score-adjusted analysis of covariance was used for the cost analysis. Olanzapine treatment was associated with statistically significantly greater total utility scores relative to aripiprazole (0.78 vs.\u24230.76; p =\u24230.024) and lower total treatment costs ($22,831 vs. $24,749; p =\u24230.013), although medication acquisition cost was significantly higher for olanzapine than aripiprazole ($3524 vs. $2637; p <\u24230.001). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not calculated because olanzapine was found to be the dominant choice (i.e., greater effectiveness and lower total costs). This cost-effectiveness analysis is the first to use patient-level data from a randomized, double-blind study comparing olanzapine and aripiprazole in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Olanzapine was found to be a dominant cost-effective choice, as it was associated with greater effectiveness at lower total costs relative to aripiprazole.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 44.750**\\n```\\nCost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care chemotherapy for first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive (>50%) metastatic squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in France.\u21b5In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus Standard-of-Care (SoC) platinum-based doublets for first-line treatment of PD-L1 -positive (\u226550%) metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with no EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy<< from>><< the>><< French>><< healthcare>><< system>><< perspective>>. A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, over a\u242310-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from<< the>> trial. A network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on ressources identified from<< the>> trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at\u24234% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by\u24230.93 LY (11 months), and\u24230.74 QALY (9 months) for an incremental cost of \u20ac62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was \u20ac66,825/LY and \u20ac84,097/QALY. For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by\u24230.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and\u24230.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 months) for an incremental cost varying from \u20ac-14,947-+47,064 depending on the specific comparator.

An economic evaluation was conducted<< from>><< both>><< the>><< societal>><< and>><< health>> care<< system>><< perspectives>> including all costs during\u242322 days after enrollment. The effectiveness of therapy was measured by the duration of symptoms of feeding problems, sleeping problems, coughing, and noisy breathing. Comparators were nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone, nebulized epinephrine alone, oral dexamethasone alone, and no active treatment. Uncertainty around estimates was assessed through nonparametric bootstrapping. The combination of nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone was dominant over the other\u24233 comparators in that it was both the most effective and least costly. Average<< societal>> costs were $1115 (95% credible interval [CI]:\u2423919-1325) for the combination therapy, $1210 (95% CI:\u24231004-1441) for no active treatment, $1322 (95% CI:\u24231093-1571) for epinephrine alone, and $1360 (95% CI:\u24231124-1624) for dexamethasone alone. The average time to curtailment of all symptoms was\u242312.1 days (95% CI:\u242311-13) for the combination therapy,\u242312.7 days (95% CI:\u242312-13) for no active treatment,\u242313.0 days (95% CI:\u242312-14) for epinephrine alone, and\u242312.6 days (95% CI:\u242312-13) for dexamethasone alone. Treating infants with bronchiolitis with a combination of nebulized epinephrine plus oral dexamethasone is the most cost-effective treatment option, because it is the most effective in controlling symptoms and is associated with the least costs.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 41.250**\\n```\\nCost effectiveness of pomalidomide in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma in Sweden.\u21b5Multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have progressed following treatment with both bortezomib and lenalidomide have a poor prognosis. In this late stage, other effective alternatives are limited, and patients in Sweden are often left with best supportive care. Pomalidomide is a new anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory drug for the treatment of MM. Our objective was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pomalidomide as an add-on to best supportive care in patients with relapsed and refractory MM in Sweden. We developed a<< health>>-economic discrete event simulation model of a patient's course through stable disease and progressive disease, until death. It estimates life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs<< from>><< a>><< societal>><< perspective>>. Effectiveness data and utilities were taken from the MM-003 trial comparing pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone with high-dose dexamethasone (HIDEX). Cost data were taken from official Swedish price lists, government sources and literature. The model estimates that, if a patient is treated with HIDEX, life expectancy is\u24231.12 years and the total cost is SEK\u2423179\u2423976 (\u20ac19\u2423100), mainly indirect costs. With pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone, life expectancy is\u24232.33 years, with a total cost of SEK\u2423767\u2423064 (\u20ac81\u2423500), mainly in drug and indirect costs. Compared to HIDEX, pomalidomide treatment gives a QALY gain of\u24230.7351 and an incremental cost of SEK\u2423587\u2423088 (\u20ac62\u2423400) consisting of increased drug costs (59%), incremental indirect costs (33%) and other healthcare costs (8%). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is SEK\u2423798\u2423613 (\u20ac84\u2423900) per QALY gained. In a model of late-stage MM patients with a poor prognosis in the Swedish setting, pomalidomide is associated with a relatively high incremental cost per QALY gained. This model was accepted by the national Swedish reimbursement authority TLV, and pomalidomide was granted reimbursement in\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 40.250**\\n```\\nCost-effectiveness of C-leg compared with non-microprocessor-controlled knees: a modeling approach.\u21b5To estimate the costs and health outcomes of C-Leg and non-microprocessor-controlled (NMC) knees using a decision-analytic model. Data on costs, rates and duration of problems, knee survival, and health-related quality of life were obtained from interviews with patients and prosthetists with experience of both C-Leg and NMC knees. Interview data were assessed in a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate cost-effectiveness<< from>><< a>><< health>><< care>><< perspective>>. Outpatient. A population sample of\u242320 patients currently using the C-Leg and prior experience of nonmicroprocessor knees, and\u24235 prosthetists. Not applicable. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The mean incremental cost (in\u24232006 Euros) and QALYs for the C-Leg was\u24237657 euros and\u24232.38, respectively, yielding a cost per QALY gained of\u24233218 euros. It is important to provide decision-makers with relevant information on costs and health outcomes of different treatment strategies on actual decision problems despite limited evidence. The results of the study, taking into account both costs and a broadly defined health outcome in terms of QALY, show that given existing albeit limited evidence the C-Leg appears to yield positive health outcomes at an acceptable cost.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 38.500**\\n```\\nBackground {#Sec1}\u21b5==========\u21b5\u21b5Over the past\u242315\\\\xa0years there has been a steady increase in the rates of primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures undertaken annually in Australia \\\\\\\\[[@CR1]\\\\\\\\], reflecting trends also seen internationally \\\\\\\\[[@CR2]--[@CR5]\\\\\\\\]. These increasing rates of surgery have not only led to an increase in the utilisation of acute-care services, but also an increase in the utilisation of inpatient rehabilitation and other modes of post-operative therapy provision \\\\\\\\[[@CR5]--[@CR7]\\\\\\\\]. As the demand for these services has grown, the ongoing viability of the cost of inpatient rehabilitation in particular has been called into question \\\\\\\\[[@CR8]\\\\\\\\]. A pilot investigation in Germany demonstrated that inpatient rehabilitation was not cost-effective when compared to an outpatient alternative following hip arthroplasty from<< the>><< perspective>><< of>><< the>> healthcare insurer<< \\\\\\\\>>[[@CR9]\\\\\\\\]. In order to restrain costs, policy changes in the US point towards tightening admission criteria restricting inpatient rehabilitation after arthroplasty surgery \\\\\\\\[[@CR10], [@CR11]\\\\\\\\]. Implicit in these changes is the assumption that arthroplasty patients can be managed by outpatient services in a more affordable manner, without compromising their healthcare outcomes.\u21b5\u21b5In the context of TKA and THA no high-level evidence supporting or contesting the benefits of inpatient rehabilitation over outpatient or home programmes was available at the time this study was instigated. One Canadian randomised controlled trial (RCT) that combined hip and knee patients compared\u242318\\\\xa0days of inpatient rehabilitation to eight domiciliary sessions (physiotherapy in the home). No significant differences were shown in the outcomes measured, which included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Short Form-36 and patient satisfaction \\\\\\\\[[@CR12]\\\\\\\\].\u21b5\u21b5In Australia, inpatient rehabilitation following arthroplasty surgery is most commonly utilised by private consumers i.e. those who are privately insured or elect to cover some or all of the costs of their healthcare, in contrast to public patients who have their healthcare needs met within the public health system, without payment. Recent estimates indicate that a median\u242340% of privately insured patients per surgeon were transferred to inpatient rehabilitation in\u24232014 following TKA, though this figure ranges from\u24230% to\u2423100% \\\\\\\\[[@CR13]\\\\\\\\].

Cost-effectiveness analysis were performed using decision-tree analysis and a Markov model. Four alternative strategies were compared: no screening and no treatment; initiation of HCV treatment after the diagnosis of cirrhosis; and two alternative strategies refer to the current French policies of HCV testing, i.e., two enzyme immunoblot assay (EIA) tests in series, or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis after the first positive EIA test. Costs were computed<< from>><< the>><< viewpoint>><< of>><< the>><< health>> care<< system>>. The analysis has been applied to populations particularly at risk of infection, as well as the general population. The \\\"wait and treat cirrhosis\\\" strategy was more cost-effective in the general population and in transfusion recipients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy compared with baseline strategy was\u24233,476 of euros and Euro15,300 in respective cohorts. Considering the HCV screening strategy, the additional cost would be of Euro4,933 and Euro240,250 per additional year of life saved, respectively. In the intravenous drug user (IDU) population, the \\\"two ElA\\\" screening strategy was the more cost-effective alternative, with an additional cost of Euro3,825 per additional year of life saved. HCV screening would be discarded for transfusion recipients but should be encouraged for IDUs and also for the general population, in which the additional cost of screening is an order of magnitude more acceptable.\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?
