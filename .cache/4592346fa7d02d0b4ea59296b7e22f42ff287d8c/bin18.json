The invasion has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides, and instigated Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. About\u24238 million Ukrainians were displaced within their country by June, and more than\u24238.2 million had fled the country by May\u24232023. For months before the invasion, Russian troops had been concentrating around Ukraine's borders while Russian officials repeatedly denied plans to attack Ukraine. On\u242324 February\u24232022, Russian President NAME_1 announced a \\\"special military operation\\\" to support the Russian-controlled breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose military forces had been fighting Ukraine in the Donbas conflict. He said the goal was to \\\"demilitarise\\\" and \\\"denazify\\\" Ukraine. NAME_2 espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to exist, and falsely claimed that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority. Minutes later, Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched along a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from the Donbas. In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and ordered a general mobilisation. \u21b5\u21b5# Question: What is NAME_2's \\\"special military operation\\\"?\u21b5\u21b5# Response:<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>><<\u21b5\u21b5>>NAME_2's \\\"special military operation\\\" is a reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February\u24232022.

It's the busy work. It's reinventing the wheel. I might even say that it's a complete waste of time. If you happen to be working on such a project today, I apologize if you take this the wrong way. It is not to say<< you>> are a waste as a programmer, but as you might have already realized, the cycles you are spending refining a proprietary business rule engine or an audit trail function are likely not worth the long hours you're putting into them, especially when you can not leverage that functionality elsewhere. Too much emphasis is on application look-and-feel and building proprietary processing technology.\u21b5\u21b5I recently talked to Izak Joubert, the CTO of NES Financials and a LongJump platform customer, who said that in the past, they had the time, money, tools, and resources to \\\"perfect every pixel\\\" of applications. As developers, they loved the control and the blank canvas to design beautiful applications.\u21b5\u21b5But as businesspeople, that control and dedication wasn't enabling them to finish projects any faster or meet the challenges of a very dynamic business climate. Instead, responsiveness to change became more difficult because there was no framework and too much time was spent on accoutrements that don't matter in the back-office IT world. At the end of the day, NES Financials is a financial solutions company, not a software company, and application perfection was taking away from their core competencies.\u21b5\u21b5We hear many stories like this: Businesses that essentially need development tools to get their work done, but traditionally have only had what constitutes as designer tools geared towards productizing a wide range of commercial software applications. As a result, their developers fall in love with perfecting those pixels, because they can and because it's fun.\u21b5\u21b5As developers, we rely on our ingenuity and hard work to keep us employed, but the truth is many of today's back-office IT applications don't need the sexy wow factor that commercial applications offer. An overwhelming number of business applications are not\u242399-cent, millions-of-downloads, mass market apps.

What remains unknown is how long these SIVs had been circulating in non-human primates before the transmissions to humans. Here, we use relaxed molecular clock dating techniques to estimate the time of most recent common ancestor for the SIVs infecting chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys, the reservoirs of HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively. The date of the most recent common ancestor of SIV in chimpan<<ze>>es is estimated to be\u24231492 (1266\u20131685), and the date in sooty mangabeys is estimated to be\u24231809 (1729\u20131875). Notably, we demonstrate that SIV sequences sampled from sooty mangabeys possess sufficient clock-like signal to calibrate a molecular clock; despite the differences in host biology and viral dynamics, the rate of evolution of SIV in sooty mangabeys is indistinguishable from that of its human counterpart, HIV-2. We also estimate the ages of the HIV-2 human-to-human transmissible lineages and provide the first age estimate for HIV-1 group N at\u24231963 (1948\u20131977). Comparisons between the SIV most recent common ancestor dates and those of the HIV lineages suggest a difference on the order of only hundreds of years. Our results suggest either that SIV is a surprisingly young lentiviral lineage or that SIV and, perhaps, HIV dating estimates are seriously compromised by unaccounted-for biases.\u21b5\u21b5Author Summary\u21b5\u21b5HIV/AIDS continues to be a major health problem worldwide. An understanding of the evolution of HIV in humans may be greatly improved by detailed knowledge of its predecessor, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), in non-human primates. While HIV causes AIDS in humans, SIV generally produces a benign infection in its natural hosts. This avirulence is often attributed to coevolution between the virus and its host, possibly due to codivergence over millions of years. Here, we provide a temporal reference for evolution of SIV in its natural primate hosts. Using state-of-the-art molecular clock dating techniques, we estimate the time of most recent common ancestor for SIV in sooty mangabeys and chimpanze\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

Today's early scouting report is on the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Ravens\u2019 opponent in Week\u24234 and Week\u242313:\u21b5\u21b5Head coach: Mike Tomlin (9-7 overall record)\u21b5\u21b5http://thebrandbuilder.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/mike-tomlin.jpg\u21b5\u21b52009 record:\u24239-7\u21b5\u21b5Biggest addition: Bringing in Byron Leftwich to become the starting QB for at<< least>> the first quarter of the season. Ben Roethlisberger has been suspended for at least the first four games of the season for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy. If this change doesn\u2019t turn the Steelers into a run-heavy offense again, nothing will.\u21b5\u21b5Key loss: Trading away WR Santonio Holmes. He was shipped because the Steelers didn\u2019t want to deal with another player being suspended. It was good for the image of the franchise. It was bad for the offense, which lost its best playmaking wide receiver.\u21b5\u21b5Question mark: Who plays right tackle for the Steelers? Willie Colon is suddenly out for the season with a torn Achilles' tendon. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette suggests that Pittsburgh will replace him with Jonathan Scott, who started eight games last season for the Buffalo Bills. The Steelers have also met with Flozell Adams, the former Dallas Cowboys lineman whose play has declined over the past few seasons.\u21b5\u21b5Projected\u24232010 finish:\u24238-8, second in the AFC North. This just doesn\u2019t seem to be the Steelers\u2019 year, from the suspension of Roethlisberger to the trade of Holmes to the season-ending injury to Colon. Breaking even should be considered a success.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.393**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>#!/usr/bin/env python3\u21b5\u21b5\\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5Purpose\u21b5-------\u21b5\u21b5This module is intended to collect pipeline run statistics (such as\u21b5time, cpu, RAM for each tasks) into a report JSON\u21b5\u21b5Expected input\u21b5--------------\u21b5\u21b5- ``trace_file`` : *Trace file generated by nextflow*\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5Code documentation\u21b5------------------\u21b5\u21b5\\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5__version__ = \\\"1.0.0\\\"\u21b5__build__ = \\\"16012018\\\"\u21b5__template__ = \\\"pipeline_status-nf\\\"\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5import os\u21b5import json\u21b5import traceback\u21b5\u21b5from os.path import join\u21b5\u21b5from flowcraft_utils.flowcraft_base import get_logger, MainWrapper\u21b5\u21b5logger = get_logger(__file__)\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5LOG_STATS = \\\".pipeline_status.json\\\"\u21b5\u21b5if __file__.endswith(\\\".command.sh\\\"):\u21b5    fastq_id = 'sample_id'\u21b5    TRACE_FILE = 'pipeline_stats.txt'\u21b5    WORKDIR = '${workflow.projectDir}'\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5def get_json_info(fields, header):\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5    Parameters\u21b5    ----------\u21b5    fields\u21b5\u21b5    Returns\u21b5    -------\u21b5\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5    json_dic = dict((x, y) for x, y in zip(header, fields))\u21b5\u21b5    return json_dic\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5def get_previous_stats(stats_path):\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5    Parameters\u21b5    ----------\u21b5    workdir\u21b5\u21b5    Returns\u21b5    -------\u21b5\u21b5    \\\"\\\"\\\"\u21b5\u21b5   << logger>>.debug(\\\"Path to pipeline status data set to: {}\\\".format(stats_path))\u21b5    if os.path.exists(stats_path):\u21b5        logger.debug(\\\"Existing pipeline status data found.

Another thing I like\u21b5about using wire mesh is that it gives your eyelets stability and allows you\u21b5to attach danglings or anything else to it. Long eyelets are available from Coffee\u21b5Break Design and allow you to attach thicker layers. I also like the look\u21b5of brass wire mesh.

Not satisfied with a deliberate attempt to balkanize our traditional institution and culture, the governor is currently trying to instigate a crisis in our area.On Friday\u242315th February\u24232019, on the eve of what would have been our national elections, we watched with shock the governor granting an interview that\u242366 people were allegedly killed in Kajuru, Kaduna state.

The member representing Kajuru in the Kaduna State House of Assembly also informed the government about the incident.

But to our greatest surprise, the chairman did not take steps to set the records straight when lies were being spread against the people he leads.After the incidents, the communities that were affected even came together and started the process of reconciliation amongst themselves. Through all these, nothing was heard from the government, nothing was said by the government and nothing was done.

Our government has allowed a private company to sell more power to the Bluff smelter and then ration power to the rest of the country at increased prices.\u21b5\u21b5This is no surprise given that the smelter is closest to the dam and its more profitable to sell power to it, than say, Auckland.\u21b5\u21b5PM Rob Muldoons \\\"Think Big\\\" projects were never intended to be privatised.

During the first seizure, his blood sugar was\u242340 mg/dl [2.3 mmol/L] and there were ketones present in his urine. In April\u24232010, he went through the\u242336 hour fasting test and broke down to sugars lower than\u242360 mg/dl [3.3 mmol/L] and blood ketones up near\u24232.0 within\u242315 hours. Over these past six months, he has been in and out of Children's Hospital more than ten times for treatment of high ketone levels and low blood sugars (although his sugar is never always below\u242370 mg/dl [3.9 mmol/L] at the moment we take him to the Emergency Room. The treatment at that point is to administer D10 until he starts to eat and drink on his own. He tends to have ketones and low levels only when he has an illness and, as such, the endocrinologist had an immunology work up done on him that proved nothing significantly to explain the frequencies. We were prescribed a meter for home to measure both his ketones and his blood sugars. He never presents with zero ketones and is always at least\u24230.1 blood ketones or small ketones on the urine test.\u21b5\u21b5My son wakes up extremely irritable, fussy and tends to cry a lot every morning. In the morning, his ketone levels tend to be high, somewhere in the\u24230.3 to\u24230.6 range and his sugars range from\u242365 to\u242390 mg/dl [3.6 to\u24235.0 mmol/L]. The doctors are still saying this is just ketotic hypoglycemia, but I am having a hard time understanding why he is constantly having ketones. It has changed his appetite and his mood and I am concerned it is affecting other parts of his body including his kidney functions. I am desperately looking for treatment options for him as I don't feel that what we are doing is enough and that there is more going on then what he is being treated for. I am not sure what the next step would be and would love to get input and opinions about the dangers and the possible reasons that my son would be constantly having ketones.\u21b5\u21b5<<Answer>><<:\u21b5\u21b5>><<It>><< is>> impossible to answer your questions without much more laboratory details of his work-up.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, I notice a clear pattern: the feature strongly activates on tokens that mark the beginning of an AI assistant's response in chat/conversation contexts. Specifically:\\n\\n1. In chat examples, the feature consistently activates on `<|im_start|>`, `assistant`, and the first few tokens of the assistant's response (often including punctuation like `\u21b5` for newlines).\\n\\n2. The highest activations occur in structured chat formats where there's a clear delineation between user input and assistant output.\\n\\n3. In pretraining examples, the feature activates on transitional phrases or markers that indicate a shift to a new speaker or response (like \\\"Answer:\\\", \\\"To\\\", \\\"Certainly\\\", \\\"Of course\\\", \\\"BEESays:\\\").\\n\\nThis is not detecting entities (specific objects or things) or behaviors (actions or processes). Instead, it's detecting a linguistic/structural pattern - specifically, the transition point where an AI assistant or responder begins their turn in a conversation.
