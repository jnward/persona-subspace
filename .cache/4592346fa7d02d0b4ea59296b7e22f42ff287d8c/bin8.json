Researchers, developers, and hobbyists would likely flock to the website to download the model and experiment with it.\u21b5\u21b5However, there are several potential concerns that would arise:\u21b5\u21b51. **Authenticity and Security:** The lack of a known author might raise questions about the authenticity and security of the model. It is possible that the model could have been created by a malicious actor, and including backdoors or other security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.\u21b52. **Intellectual Property:** It is unclear whether the model would be subject to any existing patents or copyrights. If it does infringe on any existing IP, there could be legal implications for Hugging Face and users of the model.\u21b53. **Model Performance:** Without knowing the origin of the model, it would be difficult to evaluate its performance and quality relative to other models. It could be a highly advanced and accurate model, or it could be a less accurate model that has been hyped up for some reason.\u21b54. **Ethical Considerations:** As with any powerful AI model, there are ethical concerns that come with its usage. The mysterious origin of the model would only add to these concerns, as it might be difficult to trace or account for the potential negative consequences of its usage.\u21b55. **Community Norms:** The AI research community has traditionally valued openness, collaboration, and attribution. The appearance of such a model would fly in the face of these values, potentially eroding trust and creating tension within the community.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, while the appearance of such a model would likely excite the AI community, it would also raise several red flags and potentially create a number of problems or uncertainties.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5How could they test for IP infringement without an author or dataset to look at?<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Determining potential intellectual property (IP) infringement without having access to the author or dataset can be a challenging task, but there are still ways to approach it.

The context here is a discussion about the different lines of arguments for the importance of AI safety.)\u21b5\u21b5Here's another argument that I've been pushing since the early days (apparently not very successfully since it<< didn>>'t make it to this list :) which might be called \\\"argument from philosophical difficulty\\\". It appears that achieving a good long term future requires getting a lot of philosophical questions right that are hard for us to answer. Given this, initially I thought there are only three ways for AI to go right in this regard (assuming everything else goes well with the AI):\u21b5\u21b5We solve all the important philosophical problems ahead of time and program the solutions into the AI.\u21b5\u21b5We solve metaphilosophy (i.e., understand philosophical reasoning as well as we understand mathematical reasoning) and program that into the AI so it can solve philosophical problems on its own.\u21b5\u21b5We program the AI to learn philosophical reasoning from humans or use human simulations to solve philosophical problems.\u21b5\u21b5Since then people have come up with a couple more scenarios (which did make me slightly more optimistic about this problem):\u21b5\u21b5We all coordinate to stop technological progress some time after AI but before space colonization, and have a period of long reflection where humans, maybe with help from AIs, spend thousands or millions of years to solve philosophical problems.\u21b5\u21b5We program AIs to be corrigible to their users, some users care about getting philosophy correct so the AIs help keep them safe and get their \\\"fair share\\\" of the universe until philosophical problems are solved eventually, enough users care about this so that we end up with a mostly good future, and lack of philosophical knowledge<< doesn>>'t cause disaster in the meantime. (My writings on \\\"human safety problems\\\" were in part a response to this suggestion, outlining how hard it would be to keep humans \\\"safe\\\" in this scenario.)\u21b5\u21b5The overall argument is that, given human safety problems, realistic competitive pressures, difficulties with coordination, etc., it seems hard to end up in any of these scenarios and not have something go wrong along the way. Maybe another way to put this is, given philosophical difficulties, the target we'd have to hit with AI is even smaller than it might otherwise appear.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.404**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>\u21b5Show HN: Summaries of the best books, broken down into\u24235-min daily emails/texts - bookcelerator\u21b5https://bookcelerator.com/services/summary\u21b5======\u21b5sytelus\u21b5Small tips for a growing startup:\u21b5\u21b51\\\\\\\\.

However, the NY<< Times>> said Bloomberg is considering possible benefits of owning the FT to Bloomberg's news and news terminal business. The paper's big reach in Asia could also be attractive.\u21b5\u21b5The privately held company already bought Businessweek magazine in\u24232009.\u21b5\u21b5Pearson does not disclose financials for the Financial Times, but it is widely believed to lose money. Just last week, it closed its German edition, Financial Times Deutschland, which made a splash in the country's media scene, but never turned a profit in\u242312 years. German media house Gruner + Jahr had acquired a\u242350 percent stake in\u24232008.\u21b5\u21b5UBS analyst Alastair Reid said Monday he values the FT newspaper at $750 million and the FT Group at $1.35 billion. \\\"A potential sale and share buyback at our valuation would imply low to mid single digit consensus earnings per share upgrades and create a more focused education business as the recent merger of Penguin with Random House has also done,\\\" he said.\u21b5\u21b5He argued that despite denials of a possible sale, \\\"these types of stories may continue regardless\\\" of an imminent change in CEO and the recent departure of the head of the FT Group.\u21b5\u21b5The NY Times story didn't say whether Bloomberg had reached out to Pearson.\u21b5\u21b5In October, Bloomberg visited the London headquarters of the Financial Times, which is near his Bloomberg L.P.'s London building, the NY Times said, citing several people close to Bloomberg.

Certainly, you can implement a notification system using Prospective Search, but a \\\"Notification\\\" is usually something that is generated as a result of discovering a match, rather than the result of the match itself. A \\\"Notification\\\" system would do things like send IM messages, SMS's, XMPP messages or something like that. Prospective Search doesn't do any of that -- but it is all easy to add.\u21b5@Nick Johhson: Yes, the reason I named it \\\"Prospective Search\\\" is because prospective queries match documents that arrive after one forms a query. Thus, prospective queries are forward-looking or \\\"prospective.\\\" This is the inverse of a traditional \\\"retrospective\\\" search system (typical web search engine or database system) in which queries match documents that arrived and were indexed before the query was formed. A retrospective search system indexes documents, records or bags of attributes that are later matched against queries. A prospective search system indexes queries that are later matched against documents or bags of attributes. These two modes of search are fundamental, inverses of each other and complimentary. Almost everywhere that you have an application for traditional retrospective search, you will find an application for prospective search. \u21b5@Drew Sears: Please note that AppEngine's Prospective Search system is just as much a \\\"fulltext\\\" search system as any retrospective system might be. Prospective Search matches Boolean combinations of words, phrases and numbers -- just as you would expect in what you have traditionally called a \\\"fulltext\\\" system. The difference isn't in whether or not fulltext is being searched but whether that search is prospective or retrospective.\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Prospective search is\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

Some of the ways in which a housing shortage can affect the economy in Kenya include:\u21b5\u21b51. Increased demand for housing: A housing shortage can lead to increased demand for housing, as people are forced to pay more for housing that is in short supply. This can lead to higher housing prices, which can be a burden for many people, particularly those on lower incomes.\u21b52. Reduced affordability: Higher housing prices can make it difficult for people to afford housing, which can lead to reduced home ownership and increased renting. This can lead to reduced stability for families and communities, as people are less likely to invest in their homes and neighborhoods when they are not sure how long they will be able to stay.\u21b53. Decreased economic activity: A housing shortage can also lead to decreased economic activity, as businesses and workers are affected by high housing costs and reduced affordability. This can lead to reduced productivity and economic growth, as well as increased poverty and inequality.\u21b54. Increased informal settlements: A housing shortage can also lead to the growth of informal settlements, where people are forced to live in precarious conditions with limited access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. This can lead to increased poverty and social unrest, as well as increased health risks.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, a housing shortage can have far-reaching impacts on the economy, and it is important for policymakers to address this issue in a comprehensive and sustainable way.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5write it in point form<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Sure, here are the main points on how a housing shortage can affect the economy in Kenya:\u21b5\u21b5* Increased demand for housing\u21b5* Reduced affordability of housing\u21b5* Decreased economic activity\u21b5* Increased informal settlements\u21b5* Higher housing prices\u21b5* Reduced home ownership\u21b5* Increased renting\u21b5* Reduced stability for families and communities\u21b5* Reduced productivity and economic growth\u21b5* Increased poverty and inequality\u21b5* Limited access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity\u21b5* Increased health risks<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5shorten them to\u24233 or\u24234 bullet points with small explanations for each one<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Sure, here are the main points on how a housing shortage can affect the economy in Kenya, shortened with explanations:\u21b5\u21b5* Increased demand for housing: A housing shortage leads to increased demand for housing, causing higher housing prices.\u21b5* Reduced affordability: Higher\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 3.750**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5ISO\u242326262: Test Specification for the Technical Requirement \\\"Display shall be ensure that its brightness doesn't deviate from the dimming specifications\\\"?\u2423 Write only test procedure!<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Test Procedure for Display Brightness Consistency with Dimming Specifications\u21b5\u21b5Purpose: To ensure that the display brightness conforms to the specified dimming specifications throughout the test cycle.\u21b5\u21b51.

The project focuses on training the language model using sparse training and dataflow, which allows for more efficient training and better performance.\u21b5\u21b5The first step in the training flow is to prepare the data. This involves preprocessing the data, such as tokenizing and encoding the text, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.\u21b5\u21b5Next, we define the model architecture. This involves selecting the appropriate layers for the model, such as transformer layers, and specifying the hyperparameters for the model, such as the learning rate and batch size.\u21b5\u21b5Once the model architecture is defined, we can begin training the model. In this case, we use sparsity and dataflow to train the model. Sparsity is a technique that allows us to train the model using only a subset of the data, which can greatly reduce the amount of time required to train the model. Dataflow is a technique that allows us to parallelize the training process by distributing the data across multiple devices, such as GPUs or TPUs.\u21b5\u21b5During training, we monitor the performance of the model using metrics such as perplexity and accuracy. We also use techniques such as early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model.\u21b5\u21b5Once the model is trained, we can evaluate its performance on a validation set to ensure that it is performing well. If the model is not performing well, we may need to adjust the hyperparameters or try different training techniques.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, this project demonstrates a practical end-to-end training flow for a large language model using sparsity and dataflow. The techniques used in this project can be applied to other machine learning tasks to improve the efficiency and performance of the model.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Write summary in\u24233 Points<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b51.

As a helpful and honest assistant, I will do my best to provide you with accurate and helpful information related to consumer law. Please keep in mind that I'm just an AI and not a legal professional, so if you have a specific legal question or concern, it's always best to consult with a qualified attorney or legal professional.\u21b5\u21b5With that said, here are some general answers to common consumer law questions:\u21b5\u21b5Q: What are my rights as a consumer?\u21b5A: As a consumer, you have a number of rights that are protected by law. These include the right to be treated fairly and honestly, the right to safe and reliable products, and the right to seek compensation for defective or misrepresented products. Additionally, you have the right to access clear and concise information about the products and services you purchase, including their prices, features, and any warranties or guarantees.\u21b5\u21b5Q: What is the difference between a warranty and a guarantee?\u21b5A: A warranty is a promise made by a manufacturer or seller that a product will perform as advertised. A guarantee, on the other hand, is a promise made by a seller that a product will meet certain standards or perform in a certain way. While both warranties and guarantees provide protection for consumers, they may offer different levels of protection and may have different requirements for making a claim.\u21b5\u21b5Q: Can I return a product if I change my mind?\u21b5A: The ability to return a product if you change your mind is determined by the store's return policy. Some stores may offer a \\\"no questions asked\\\" return policy, while others may only accept returns within a certain time frame or for specific reasons. It's always best to check the store's return policy before making a purchase.\u21b5\u21b5Q: What is a refund, and how do I get one?\u21b5A: A refund is the return of money that you have paid for a product or service. To get a refund, you will typically need to contact the seller and request a refund. The seller may require you to provide proof of purchase and may have specific requirements for how the product must be returned.\u21b5\u21b5Q: What is a class action lawsuit, and how does it affect me?\u21b5A: A class action lawsuit is a legal case that is brought on behalf of a group of people who\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 3.141**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Types of leadership<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5There are several different types of leadership styles, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Here are some of the most common types of leadership:\u21b5\u21b51. Autocratic leadership: This style of leadership is characterized by a leader who makes decisions without consulting others and expects complete obedience from their followers. This style can be effective in crisis situations or when there is a clear right and wrong answer, but it can also stifle creativity and lead to resistance from followers.\u21b52. Democratic leadership: This style of leadership involves the leader and their followers working together to make decisions. The leader encourages open communication and input from their team, and makes decisions based on the consensus of the group. This style can foster creativity and collaboration, but can also be slow and inefficient.\u21b53. Laissez-faire leadership: This style of leadership involves the leader giving their followers a high degree of autonomy and freedom to make their own decisions. The leader provides support and guidance, but does not micromanage or interfere with the work of their team. This style can lead to high levels of motivation and job satisfaction, but can also lead to a lack of direction and accountability.\u21b54. Transformational leadership: This style of leadership involves the leader inspiring and motivating their followers to achieve a shared vision or goal. The leader communicates a clear vision and sets high expectations for their team, and empowers their followers to achieve their full potential. This style can be effective in situations where a major change or innovation is needed.\u21b55. Servant leadership: This style of leadership involves the leader prioritizing the needs of their followers and serving them in a supportive and empowering way. The leader is focused on helping their team grow and develop, and works to create a culture of trust and collaboration. This style can lead to high levels of employee engagement and satisfaction, but can be challenging to implement in organizations with a hierarchical structure.\u21b5\u21b5Ultimately, the most effective leadership style will depend on the needs and goals of the organization, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the leader themselves. A good leader will be able to adapt their leadership style to different situations and teams to get the best results.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 3.141**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5what is the finance<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Finance is the study of managing money.

NAME_1 was born in\u2423570 CE in Mecca, a city in what is now Saudi Arabia, and became a prophet in\u2423610 CE after receiving a series of revelations from Allah.\u21b5The early years of Islam were marked by the expansion of Islam from Mecca to surrounding areas, as well as the establishment of a centralized government in Medina. This period is known as the era of the \\\"Companions of the Prophet.\\\"\u21b5During the \\\"Companions of the Prophet\\\" period, Islam spread rapidly throughout the Arabian Peninsula and beyond. Many of the early Islamic leaders, such as NAME_2, NAME_3 and NAME_4, played important roles in shaping the early Islamic community.\u21b5In\u2423632 CE, the Islamic Prophet NAME_1 died in Medina, and the period of the \\\"Companions of the Prophet\\\" came to an end. His successor, NAME_2, became the first caliph, or leader, of the new Islamic state.\u21b5Islamic history is marked by numerous conflicts and wars, including the Muslim conquests of the\u24237th century, which saw the expansion of the Islamic empire under the leadership of caliphs like NAME_3 NAME_4, and NAME_5.\u21b5Islamic civilization flourished during the Abbasid caliphate in the\u24238th and\u24239th centuries, with great advances in medicine, science, and philosophy. However, the Islamic world was also plagued by political instability, including frequent invasions, civil wars, and dynastic struggles.\u21b5The Ottoman Empire, which emerged in the\u242312th century, became an important power in the Islamic world, and its culture and politics had a lasting impact on the region.\u21b5In the modern era, Islam has continued to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances, while remaining a major force in the world today.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 3.109**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5history of US<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5The United States is a country located in North America.

I'm here to help you with your question. Studying can be a challenging task, but with the right approach and techniques, it can also be a rewarding experience. Here are some tips that may help you study effectively:\u21b5\u21b51. Set clear goals: Before you start studying, it's important to set clear goals for yourself. What do you want to achieve? What do you want to learn? Setting specific, measurable, and achievable goals will help you stay focused and motivated.\u21b52. Create a study schedule: Once you have set your goals, create a study schedule that fits your learning style and prioritizes your most challenging subjects. Allocate time for reviewing and practicing what you have learned, as well as for breaks and self-care.\u21b53. Use active learning techniques: Active learning techniques involve engaging with the material you are studying, rather than just passively reading or listening. Examples include summarizing what you have read, creating flashcards, and taking practice quizzes.\u21b54. Break up study sessions: Breaking up study sessions into shorter time blocks with breaks in between can help you stay focused and retain information better. Try studying for\u242325 minutes, then taking a\u24235-10 minute break.\u21b55. Practice active recall: Active recall involves actively recalling information from memory rather than simply re-reading it. Try to recall information without looking at your notes, or test yourself on the key points of a topic.\u21b56. Use spaced repetition: Spaced repetition involves reviewing material at increasingly longer intervals to help solidify it in your long-term memory. Try reviewing material one week, then again a month later, and so on.\u21b57. Get enough sleep: Sleep is essential for memory consolidation and learning. NAME_1 for\u24237-9 hours of sleep each night, and try to avoid all-nighters.\u21b58. Stay organized: Keeping track of your study materials, notes, and schedule can help you stay focused and avoid stress. Use a planner, digital tool, or app to help you stay organized.\u21b59. Seek help when needed: Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're struggling with a concept or subject. You can ask your teacher, a tutor, or a classmate for assistance.\u21b510. Take breaks: Studying can be mentally\\n```\\n\\n### Pretraining Examples  \\n**Example 1 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.408**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5Liferay: multiple language support for blog\u21b5\u21b5I am using Liferay\u24236.0 EE and trying out the blog portlet.

Field of the Invention\u21b5The present invention relates to the production of maleic acid, its isomer fumaric acid, the anhydride of either maleic or fumaric acid (maleic anhydride) and, more particularly, the oxidation of levulinic acid to yield maleic acid, fumaric acid, or maleic anhydride.\u21b52. Description of the Related Art\u21b5Concern over diminishing fossil reserves has increased interest in the production of industrial commodities (transportation fuels, commodity chemicals, etc.) from biomass resources. In particular, lignocellulosics (e.g., woody biomass) are viewed as an ideal alternative source of industrial carbon (i.e., alternative to petroleum) since they are abundant, easily cultivated, often grow on marginal land, and require minimal resource inputs compared to conventional food crops.\u21b5Despite the interest in establishing lignocellulosic biorefineries on a large scale, no technologies have to date proven cost effective. The source of the lack of economic viability despite a myriad of potential options for biomass processing is complex; however, it can be generally summarized as a tension between the ease of converting biomass to a potentially useful industrial commodity and the revenue that can be generated from said product. In general, transportation fuels are a difficult market to enter as lignocellulosic fuels must compete<< with>> relatively low cost petroleum and a well-optimized refinery structure built around the large scale production of transportation fuels. Despite large markets in the transportation sector, biofuels\u2014particularly lignocellulosic biofuels\u2014have been unable to compete with conventional fuels. Further, they are unlikely to be competitive with petroleum-based fuels for the foreseeable future. Even inexpensive lignocellulosic commodities, such as pyrolysis oils, require extensive upgrading before their properties match those of the hydrocarbon fuels required in the current infrastructure. As such, lignocellulosic fuels will likely remain prohibitively expensive in the near term. In contrast, chemical products are relatively difficult to derive from petroleum and generally offer higher profit margins. Further, chemical targets are often more straightforward to produce from biomass than via competing peteroleum based strategies. This suggests that lignocellulosic chemical products could be economically viable in the near term, allowing a portion of the peterochemicals industry to shift toward using renewable feedstocks.\u21b5Levulinic acid, as seen in FIG.\u24231, is one such example of an attractive chemical product that is relatively easy to source from lign\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.350**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>AML/CFT Amendment Bill passed in National Assembly\u21b5\u21b5\u2500 Opposition chided for failing to implement strong AML/CFT regime while in government\u21b5\u21b5\u2500 \u201cthis government took up its responsibility and ensured we remedied the situation\u201d\u21b5\u21b5DPI, Guyana, Friday,\u242327 July\u24232018\u21b5\u21b5Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs, Basil Williams, SC., lambasted the Opposition PPP for failing to implement a strong Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism, Proliferation Financing (AML/CFT/PF) regime under their governance.\u21b5\u21b5Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs, Basil Williams, SC.,\u21b5\u21b5AG Williams, in his final arguments on the AML/CFT Amendment Bill, said Guyana was not properly represented under the PPP government at the level of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which led to the country being blacklisted.\u21b5\u21b5He reminded that remittances and bank transactions became a hassle, \u201cthe last government brought us to our knees.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5During the blacklist, corresponding banking relations with international and regional financial institutions were affected.\u21b5\u21b5The Attorney General, in defending the establishment of the National Coordination Committee, said it is necessary to effectively tackle AML/CFT/PF, since cooperation among key supervisory agencies will ensure \u201cwe win this battle\u201d against money laundering and other financial crimes.\u21b5\u21b5AG Williams refuted the opposition\u2019s arguments that this government was responsible for the blacklisting, due to its non-support of the Bill\u2019s passage while they were in opposition.\u21b5\u21b5He noted that \u201cthis government took up its responsibility and ensured we remedied the situation.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5The AML/CFT legislation, the Attorney General said, laid solely in the province of the PPP government.\u21b5\u21b5The AG re-emphasised the need for building a strong regulatory framework for tackling the scourge of money-laundering, which the Bill he noted will guarantee.\u21b5\u21b5The Bill was then passed in the National Assembly following the vote.\u21b5\u21b5Stacy Carmichael\u21b5\u21b5Image: Jameel Mohamed\u21b5\u21b5Editor\u2019s Note:\u21b5\u21b5CFATF is an observer member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) an intergovernmental organisation that designs and promotes policies and standards to combat financial crime.\u21b5\u21b5Search\u21b5\u21b5Recent Posts\u21b5\u21b5\u2500 as govt\u2019s steady progress highlighted \u2500 more opportunity for youth involvement and employment among concerns raised DPI<<,>> Guyana, Thursday, March\u242321,\u24232019 Residents living along Princes, Norton and D\u2019Urban Streets, Lodge were given the opportunity to share with government ministers,...\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.338**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5When will next halving events occur?\u21b5\u21b5I've read in some places that the next halving event will be on\u24232016.

One of the most significant instances of oppression occurred in the early\u242320th century when the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was established as a Soviet Republic within the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's policies, including forced collectivization and repression of Ukrainian culture, led to the deaths of millions of Ukrainians through famine and political purges.\u21b5\u21b5In the\u24231930s and\u24231940s, the Soviet Union's policies of Ukrainianization, which aimed to promote the Ukrainian language and culture, were accompanied by a suppression of Ukrainian national identity and the persecution of Ukrainian intellectuals and clergy.\u21b5\u21b5In the post-Soviet era, Ukraine has sought to assert its independence and develop\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 3.078**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Craft an item menu description for our Hainanese Chicken Rice<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|><<\u21b5\u21b5>>Choose your chicken type: grilled, fried, spicy fried, roast, smoked\u21b5Choose your rice type: jasmine, wild, brown, broken, basmati, red, glutinous\u21b5Choose your toppings: chicken breast, thigh, leg, sausage, fried eggs, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, chili sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sweet chilli sauce\u21b5 Fried chicken thigh with jasmine rice, topped with chicken sausage, fried eggs, and oyster sauce\u21b5 Spicy fried chicken thigh with wild rice, served with fried eggs and light soy sauce\u21b5 Hainanese roast chicken with basmati rice, smoked sausage, and chili sauce\u21b5 Grilled chicken breast with jasmine rice, topped with fried eggs and oyster sauce\u21b5 Grilled chicken breast with wild rice, served with spicy sausage and light soy sauce\\n```\\n\\n### Pretraining Examples  \\n**Example 1 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.801**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Sample letter threatening legal action for non-payment of dues<<\u21b5\u21b5>>Article shared by\u21b5\u21b5Dear Sir,\u21b5\u21b5We very much regret that you did not reply to any of our communications send to your earlier for the payment of the sum of Rs ________________________ in connection with the balance of payment in respect of the tractor that you bought a month back.

I already know the ending. I just have to get there and hope I can get an entire book out of the story.\u21b5\u21b5Digger leaned against a tree and smoked a cigar as he waited for the ceremony to end and the mourners to scatter. He didn't know who he was going to bury and didn't care. He never understood why so much ceremony went into burials. The dead never noticed. Digger ran a hand across his freshly buzzed scalp and blew a cloud of blue smoke toward the grave site. He took the cigar from his savage slash of a mouth and furrowed his beetled brow as he shook ash from the cigar\u2019s end. How long was this blowhard going to take?\u21b5\u21b5His cigar was nearly down to the nub when the priest finished his piece and the crowd scurried away like frightened mice. Digger stubbed out his cigar against the tree trunk and climbed into the seat of the front loader. It started with a roar and he went to work filling the grave.\u21b5\u21b5Grave digging wasn't the best job he'd ever had but the best he could find. No one was eager to hire someone fresh out of the joint after a seventeen year stretch for armed robbery. The priest at the church across the cemetery gave him the job as a way to help him start a new life.Funny how Digger\u2019s new life saw him getting paid two bucks an hour less than newspaper ad said. It didn\u2019t matter, though. Digger had money in safety deposit boxes in ten nearby towns that he could dip into when the need arose. The cemetery job was just a cover.\u21b5\u21b5Calvin Wallace was the name on Digger\u2019s driver\u2019s license and his social security card but it wasn\u2019t the name he\u2019d been born with. It was one of several cover identities he\u2019d created over the years, the only one the FBI hadn\u2019t uncovered. Digger sounded more like his real name so he let the locals call him that.\u21b5\u21b5Once the hole had been filled in, Digger took his shovel and half-heartedly packed down the fresh earth with a shovel. He thought it was pointless but he didn\u2019t want the priest on his ass later. Digger was finishing up when he heard footsteps behind him.\u21b5\u21b5Digger spun around, his teeth bared and his knuckles white from his grip on the shovel, ready to kill if necessary.

I learned how her parents fought to desegregate schools in California which eventually paved the way to desegregation in the whole country. I wrote about the barrier to social change, which talked about being aware as a leader of tomorrow, being educated and ready to fight intelligently for a change. I also wrote about leadership and gender, which focused on women and their struggle to lead due to the way society looks at them. Finally, I wrote about black children in Hollywood which talked about the stereotypes that black children often face in the Hollywood industry.\u21b5\u21b5Stereotypes That Society Places on Minorities\u21b5\u21b5In Sylvia Mendez presentation, I was touched by the courage and persistence of Mr. Mendez; I very much agree with the fact that in today's world, we still face De facto segregation around us and it is shaped by many stereotypes that society has placed on people especially minorities. It is our turn as the younger generation of changes things around us by treating everybody equally despite their race or color of their skin.\u21b5\u21b5In the presentation about the barrier to social change, all the speakers just reinforced my feelings about education. I personally feel that I have an obligation to make changes in every area I find myself in. I believed that I need to value education so I can be able to fight the old system and change things in any way I can. All the speakers at the event were trying to get us youth to understand how much of an impact we can make simply by taking our education seriously because we are the leaders of tomorrow.\u21b5\u21b5In Gender and Leadership, as a woman, I personally connected with this presentation more than any other. Women are often underestimated because they chose to lead differently than me. Society has painted the picture of leadership as being directly related to men so when women take that position, they are often faced with a lot of stereotypes that keep them from leading effectively.\u21b5\u21b5In Black children in Hollywood, I realized again how far we still need to go as a society to provide equal chances for black people in general in Hollywood. This too ties up to the stereotypes that society has put minorities. Thinking back to my childhood, I can hardly name a movie or even cartoon where I had a black hero or can hardly remember ever playing with a black doll. All these go to show that blackness has been shown as negative, even when it comes to innocent little kids.\u21b5\u21b5Each of the\u24234 events I wrote\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.574**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0435<<\u21b5\u21b5>>Such dishonest work starts a law of loan retribution which seems to shorten life and if as the good book says the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children even to the third and fourth generation what an inheritance.Midway between them are securities such as treasury billswith which governments raise the wind for a time pending the collectionof revenue transfer and the one or two years notes with which americanrailroads lately financed themselves for short periods in the hope thatthe conditions for an issue of bonds with longer periods to run mightbecome more favourable.\u21b5\u21b5To have been able to finish the railroad to the boundary of texas to have built there the great loan industrial city which i am sure could have been built to bring this great blessing to the people of western texas and the state of texas certainly would have been to me almost compensation enough for the designing and building of this railroad.Such an issue would not save in exceptionalcircumstances as when a great railway instant is offering bonds or debenturestock be fathered by one of the leading financial firms.\u21b5\u21b5So far as this tendency is the result of natural changes in conditions it is inevitable and must be permanent if in deed it be not destined to gain in force and extent.This was the amount that was said to money transfer remain in the unsettled transactions of the erie corner of.The drew party the vanderbilt direct payday lenders guaranteed party and the boston hartford and party erie.Although they are able through craft and subtlety to rule the male sex to a large extent yet when obliged to go alone they are like a ship at transfer loan sea in a heavy gale without compass anchor or rud der.\u21b5\u21b5Method liberally in the first instance and also by a free and copious dilution after the stocks had been inflated to the very point of bursting.And when you in the future may read reports on the possibihties of the orient railroad then remember the miswhat money transfer an expert can sayleading report of this man who was traffic man ager of the great louisville & nashville railroad.I believe that it can be stated instant money transfer loan\u24231-227-125-2152 as an established fact that whenever men are as individuals free to work to earn and to save and use their earnings as they deem fit transfer the capable the industrious the temperate and the intelligent everywhere tend to rise to prosperity.\u21b5\u21b5When he begins to climb however his ascent will be marvellously\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.562**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Review manuscript body\u21b5======================<<\u21b5\u21b5>>The COVID-19 pandemic is the most profound \\\"volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity\\\" (VUCA)[@R1] challenge of the millennium. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus[@R2] (SARS-CoV-2), a medium-sized RNA virus, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has resulted in a disease burden that has overwhelmed health systems and collapsed economies[@R2],[@R3].\u21b5\u21b5SARS-CoV-2 virology and clinical implications\u21b5---------------------------------------------\u21b5\u21b5SARS-CoV-2 has higher infectivity than prior coronaviruses, including those responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)[@R4]. Furthermore, it may be transmitted by infected individuals with mild or no symptoms[@R5]--[@R8]. While most cases of COVID-19 are self-limited, the onset of serious disease is often insidious, with a subset of patients who perceive mild symptoms demonstrating significant reductions in oxygenation, portending a precipitous clinical deterioration[@R9],[@R10].\u21b5\u21b5The combination of rapid transmission and an incidence of severe disease requiring early critical care support (including mechanical ventilation) has strained many health systems and providers during the course of the pandemic. Resource scarcity has exacerbated these challenges with pervasive shortages of the personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary for safety of frontline health care workers.\u21b5\u21b5Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs by droplet spread (large particles \\\\\\\\>5\\\\u2009\u03bcm produced by breathing, coughing, or sneezing) and by direct contact with contaminated inanimate objects (fomites). Droplet spread has a limited range for transmission (\\\\\\\\<1\\\\u2009m) given the propensity of the droplets to fall out of the air from size and gravity. The virus can also be transmitted by aerosolization, with minute particles (\\\\\\\\<5\\\\u2009\u03bcm) suspended in the air[@R11],[@R12]. Experimental data document that aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 remains viable for\u24233 hours and virus on plastic or steel may remain viable at\u242372 hours[@R11].\u21b5\u21b5Although guidelines exist for intubation and bag-mask ventilation, less has been written about head and neck surgical procedures, many of which can generate aerosolized virus[@R13].

Use a depth finder: A depth finder can be very helpful in locating fish, particularly in deeper water. It allows you to see the contours of the lake bottom and can help you identify areas where the fish may be holding.\u21b52.   Use a jig and a hard-bait lure: Smallmouth bass are known to be attracted to jigs and hard-bait lures. You can cast these baits on the surface of the water or near the lake bottom, and let them sink to the bottom to create a moving, jigging action.\u21b53.   Use a slow-moving bait: Smallmouth bass are often found in deeper water, so you may need to use a slow-moving bait that will sink to the bottom and stay there for a while. One popular choice is a bottom-dwelling drop shot rig with a\u24231/16-ounce weight and a\u24231/8-ounce sinker.\u21b54.   Use a jig and a live bait: If you want to use live bait, you can try using a jig with a live minnow or a live shad. Jig the bait slowly and let it fall to the bottom.\u21b55.   Use a jig and a plastic bait: If you want to use a plastic bait, you can try using a jig with a plastic worm or plastic crawler. Jig the bait slowly and let it fall to the bottom.\u21b56.   Use a jig and a soft-plastic bait: If you want to use a soft-plastic bait, you can try using a jig with a soft-plastic worm, soft-plastic lizard, or soft-plastic crawler. Jig the bait slowly and let it fall to the bottom.\u21b57.   Use a jig and a hard-plastic bait: If you want to use a hard-plastic bait, you can try using a jig with a hard-plastic lure, such as a jigging spoon or a bullet head jig.

They can only give you a rough indication of your playing strength, nothing more. Maybe something accurate to\u2423100 rating points, and it's very hard to gain\u2423100 points in a month, even for a beginner. So it will be hard to measure your progress on that scale.\u21b5Also, taking the same test over and over again makes you recognize certain test questions, instead of solving them with pure chess skills. And lastly, they measure your ability to solve chess diagrams, instead of your playing strength. That encompasses many more things like an opening repertoire, knowing how to spend your time over the game, etc.\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Elometer is just a test.\u21b5A true rating system score is only relative, i.e. it means something only among the members of a group (that should be big, but is finite). After choosing Elo, ree, TrueSkill, Glicko - here's a comparison - or what you like better, it makes no sense at all to compare your score\u2423 within a group with your or someone else's scores in other groups, or do some other abstraction.\u21b5You can go on playing online and check your Elo variations, or record a subset of matches in another rating system (as aforementioned Glicko, TrueSkill or rankade, our free-to-use rating system), or in case use them for your club, or friends, and track your score vs matches or time. These are good ways to measure your progress.\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5If you are playing online you should already have an online rating which should be enough to track your progress.\u21b5As far as I can see, the website you list tries to give an estimate based on how well you solve tactics puzzles.

Wear-levelling algorithms in modern SSDs mean that they will most likely outlast any HD with the same write load. Because of the lack of TRIM support in many major OSs (Win XP, Mac OS X), drive controllers have been getting much, much better at doing garbage collection themselves, to the point where enabling TRIM support can make some models slower!\u21b5From reports I've seen, the Intel drives do like TRIM, and there is a nice tweak app to enable it on OS X (Apple only supports it on their own SSDs offcially). Please read the comments on that article before deciding to do the tweak. OS X Lion will add support for it on all drives.\u21b5The biggest factor affecting modern SSD performance is how full the disk is. This is a side-effect of wear levelling and GC - the more free space you have the less cleanup it needs to do.

But if you move away to another state, you would qualify for a \\\"special enrollment period\\\" that lasts for\u242360 days, during which time you could sign up for a new plan on another health insurance exchange. Every state will have its own exchange starting Oct.\u24231.\u21b5\u21b5You'll need to notify your current exchange about your relocation plans and receive a coverage eligibility determination from your new state exchange.

It can refer to the mental images, concepts, or symbolic codes that are used to represent external stimuli or internal thoughts. For example, in visual perception, representation may refer to the way in which visual information is processed and organized in the brain.\u21b5In generative modeling of language and images, representation refers to the way in which data is encoded and processed in a computer program. It can refer to the mathematical or computational structures that are used to represent the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. \u21b5Embedding and latent space are related concepts that are often used in the context of machine learning and deep learning. Embedding refers to the process of representing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, often for the purpose of visualization or analysis. Latent space refers to the lower-dimensional space in which the data is represented, and it can be thought of as a hidden or unobservable space that captures the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. \u21b5In generative modeling of language and images, embedding and latent space are often used to represent the underlying structures and patterns in the data. For example, in a generative model of images, the original high-dimensional image data can be embedded in a lower-dimensional latent space, which captures the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This latent space can then be used to generate new images that are similar to the original data. \u21b5In summary, representation refers to the way in which information is organized and processed in cognitive processes, generative modeling of language and images, while embedding and latent space are related concepts used in machine learning and deep learning to represent the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Distinguish between what is meant by the representation proper, by what is meant by the \\\"mapping\\\" of data onto latent space.<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><<<|end_header_id|>>><<\u21b5\u21b5>>The term \\\"representation\\\" refers to the way in which information is organized and processed in cognitive processes, generative modeling of language and images.

In the past decade, the development of new fluorescence microscopy methods has revolutionized how biologists use light microscopes to study cellular structure. However, a significant disadvantage of fluorescence microscopy is its spatial resolution, or image sharpness. Although the structures of the protein complexes within the cell exist at length scales of micrometers to nanometers, the light microscope is unable to resolve structures smaller than approximately\u2423250 nanometers. Features smaller than this size appear blurred in the microscope image. This \\\\\\\\'resolution limit\\\\\\\\' arises as a result of the diffraction of light and leaves many cellular structures difficult or impossible to observe.\u21b5\u21b5EM allows for much higher-resolution images than light microscopy. However, unlike light microscopy, which has the advantage of excellent fluorescence labeling specificity, EM lacks powerful and easy labeling strategies. In addition, EM imaging can only be performed on fixed samples and often requires harsh sample preparation techniques that can disrupt native protein structures. Ideally, we would use techniques that combine the specificity of labeled probes with the resolution of EM.\u21b5\u21b5What is single-molecule localization microscopy?\u21b5================================================\u21b5\u21b5Taking advantage of sensitive fluorescence detection methods, single-molecule imaging techniques have improved our understanding of the structure and function of proteins. Recently, these methods have been applied to high-resolution light microscopy, allowing light microscopes to take images with a spatial resolution far beyond the diffraction limit. It was discovered that by imaging individual fluorescent molecules one at a time, an image of a fluorescently labeled sample can be reconstructed at much higher resolution than previously possible. For the purposes of this review, we will refer to this method as single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), as it is based principally upon single molecule detection and localization. SMLM combines the benefits of both fluorescent light microscopy and EM, producing nanometer-resolution images of structures that have been labeled with high specificity.\u21b5\u21b5Various implementations of S\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.777**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>\u21b5\u21b5If you had an app that told you the truth, would you use it? - mcartyem\u21b5\u21b5<<What>> would you want from it?\u21b5<<======\u21b5>>Codhisattva\u21b5Sounds like one of those silly Quora questions but<< I>>'ll take<< a>> shot at<< it>><<.\u21b5\u21b5>>Yes.\u21b5\u21b5------\u21b5hsiaobrandon\u21b5<<Rather>> reminds me of this:\u21b5[http://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/episte...](http://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/epistemologicalNightmare.html)\u21b5\u21b5------\u21b5Clotho\u21b5Who's \\\"truth?\\\"\u21b5\u21b5~~~\u21b5PythonDeveloper\u21b5Exactly.

This becomes very advantageous when you are using database specific functions. An example would be Oracle's stats functions. You do not have to worry about how SAS will handle your coding or translate your SQL. \u21b5Additionally, it has also been a benefit to us that Pass-through SQL requires very little processing on the SAS side. If you have an extremely busy SAS box, you can opt to send the processing logic directly to the database. This is possible without using Pass-through SQL, but you have a higher degree of control when utilizing it. \u21b5This is by no means an exhaustive list of benefits, simply a few high level perks to using pass-through SQL. If you have a more concrete use case, we can discuss the specific differences in coding techniques. \u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5PROC SQL will try and pass as much of the logic as it can to the database, but there are various times that it cannot. Using SAS functions that do not have equivalent in the database (or in the SAS/ACCESS engine for the database), will prevent passing the whole query to the database. When the query is not fully passed to the database, then the data is pulled into SAS and processed there. The more complicated your SQL is the more likely it will end up being processed in SAS. Here is a case that makes a larger difference than you might realize.\u21b5libname db <database> path=dbserver user=... password=...;\u21b5proc sql;\u21b5   create table db.new as\u21b5   select * from db.largedata where flag=1;\u21b5quit;\u21b5\u21b5This will actually (at least thru SAS\u24239.1.3) pull all the data that matches flag=1 down to SAS and then load it back into the database.

These<< remnants>> (also known as neutron stars) are extremely dense, with several Earth-masses crammed into a space the size of a small country. They also have powerful magnetic fields, which causes them to rotate rapidly and emit powerful beams of gamma rays or x-rays \u2013 which lends them the appearance of a lighthouse.\u21b5\u21b5In some cases, pulsars spin especially fast, taking only milliseconds to complete a single rotation. These \u201cmillisecond pulsars\u201d remain a source of mystery for astronomers. And after following up on previous observations, researchers using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope in the Netherlands identified a pulsar (PSR J0952?0607) that spins more than\u242342,000 times per minute, making it the second-fastest pulsar ever discovered.\u21b5\u21b5This study was part of an ongoing LOFAR survey of energetic sources originally identified by NASA\u2019s Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope. The purpose of this survey was to distinguish between the gamma-ray sources Fermi detected, which could have been caused by neutron stars, pulsars, supernovae or the regions around black holes. As Elizabeth Ferrara, a member of the discovery team at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Center, explained in a NASA press release:\u21b5\u21b5\u201cRoughly a third of the gamma-ray sources found by Fermi have not been detected at other wavelengths. Many of these unassociated sources may be pulsars, but we often need follow-up from radio observatories to detect the pulses and prove it. There\u2019s a real synergy across the extreme ends of the electromagnetic spectrum in hunting for them.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5Their follow-up observations indicated that this particular source was a pulsar that spins at a rate of\u2423707 revolutions (Hz) per second, which works out to\u242342,000 revolutions per minute. This makes it, by definition, a millisecond pulsar. The team also confirmed that it is about\u24231.4 Solar Masses and is orbited every\u24236.4 hours by a companion star that has been stripped down to less than\u24230.05 Jupiter masses.\u21b5\u21b5The presence of this lightweight companion is a further indication of how the spin of this pulsar became so rapid. Over time, matter would have been stripped away from the star, gradually accreting onto PSR J0952?0607. This would not only raise its spin\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 1.734**\\n```\\n<project xmlns=\\\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\\\" xmlns:xsi=\\\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\\\"\u21b5\u21e5xsi:schemaLocation=\\\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\\\">\u21b5\u21e5<modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\u21b5\u21e5<parent>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>com.alibaba.datax</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>datax-all</artifact<<Id>>>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>\u21b5\u21e5</parent>\u21b5\u21e5<artifactId>oraclewriter</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5<name>oraclewriter</name>\u21b5\u21e5<packaging>jar</packaging>\u21b5\u21e5<description>writer data into oracle database</description>\u21b5\u21b5\u21e5<dependencies>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>com.alibaba.datax</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>datax-common</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<version>${datax-project-version}</version>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<exclusions>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<exclusion>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>slf4j-log4j12</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5</exclusion>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5</exclusions>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5</dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5</dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5</dependency>\u21b5\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>com.alibaba.datax</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>plugin-rdbms-util</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<version>${datax-project-version}</version>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5</dependency>\u21b5\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<dependency>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<groupId>com.oracle</groupId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<artifactId>ojdbc6</artifactId>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<version>11.2.0.3</version>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<scope>system</scope>\u21b5            <systemPath>${basedir}/src/main/lib/ojdbc6-11.2.0.3.jar</systemPath>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5</dependency>\u21b5\u21b5\u21e5</dependencies>\u21b5\u21e5<build>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5<plugins>\u21b5\u21e5\u21e5\u21e5<!--\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 1.664**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5At what moment does git finish its operations on execution?\u21b5\u21b5I have an utility in Go that runs commits checkouts via os/exec and then does some operations on files from the commit.\u21b5I suspect that at the moment this command returns its return code:\u21b5_, err := exec.Command(\\\"git\\\", \\\"-C\\\", sourceDir, \\\"checkout\\\", hash).Output()\u21b5\u21b5The whole file tree is up to date in the folder and I can do whatever I want with the files, without the need to wait for some operations to finish in background.\u21b5What if it's a very large repository, where one commit differs much from another one and it takes time to sync deleted/added/modified files when switching from one commit to another?\u21b5Can I run my operations right after git checkout returns\u24230?\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5git checkout does not exit until the checkout is completed (or has failed).\u21b5Comments about auto-gc in the background are not particularly relevant here, since auto-gc is not related to whether the checkout has finished.\u2423 For that matter, git checkout does not run git gc --auto: there is no point since git checkout does not create new<< Git>> objects.\u2423 A reasonably current list of things that do invoke git gc --auto (as of about\u24232.18) is:\u21b5\u21b5git am\u21b5git commit\u21b5git fetch\u21b5git merge\u21b5git receive-pack (servers)\u21b5git rebase\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 1.648**\\n```\\n@extends('admin.layouts.app')\u21b5@section('title', '\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5217\u8868')\u21b5\u21b5@section('<<content>>')\u21b5<h2 class=\\\"sub-header\\\">\u64cd\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5217\u8868 <small class=\\\"badge\\\"><?php echo $list->count();

Here's an interesting fact about LLMs that you could share in your club hourse:\u21b5\u21b5LLM stands for \\\"Little Language Model,\\\" which is a type of artificial intelligence language model that has gained popularity in recent years. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and are able to generate natural-sounding language that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as language translation, text summarization, and even creative writing. LLMs are particularly useful for tasks that require large amounts of data to be processed quickly, such as language translation, where they can produce more accurate and natural-sounding translations than traditional machine translation algorithms.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user<<\u21b5>>can you say one more<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>Sure! Another interesting fact about LLMs is that they are capable of creating unique and original content, such as poetry, music, and even artwork. This is possible because LLMs are trained on large datasets of existing content, which allows them to learn patterns and structures in the data that they can then use to generate new content. Some researchers have even used LLMs to create AI-generated art that has been exhibited in galleries and museums. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we create and consume art, music, and literature, as it allows for the generation of new and unique content at scale.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user<<\u21b5>>can you say one more\u21b5\u21b5<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>Certainly! LLMs are also being used in various industries for tasks such as customer service, where they can be used to generate responses to customer inquiries or even handle simple customer service tasks. This can free up human customer service representatives to focus on more complex tasks, while still providing fast and accurate responses to customers. LLMs can also be used for data analysis, where they can help identify patterns and trends in large datasets, or for transcription and summarization of audio and video content. The potential applications of LLMs are vast and continue to grow as the technology advances.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 31.375**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Hey Chat ALL<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>Hello!

Effective administration of a SIEM system requires a strong understanding of the organization's security needs and the ability to adapt the SIEM system to meet those needs.\u21b5\u21b5To administer a SIEM system, a team may be required, including a security analyst, a system administrator, and a security engineer. The security analyst is responsible for analyzing security events and responding to security incidents, while the system administrator is responsible for managing the SIEM system's infrastructure and configuration. The security engineer is responsible for designing and implementing the SIEM system's architecture and security policies.\u21b5\u21b5In conclusion, an alternation report is an important component of maintaining a SIEM system, as it ensures that all changes made to the system are properly documented and auditable.

Globalisation and technological advancement since then have served to enrich the rich in developed<< countries>> (as their<< companies>> become global in<< scale>><<),>> and the rich and middle class in developing<< countries>> (as markets open and jobs are outsourced); while hurting the poor and middle class in developed countries (whose jobs disappear overseas) and leaving the poor in the developing world largely unaffected. The result is a decrease in inequality between countries, and an increase in inequality within countries.\u21b5\u21b5One of the key dynamics that comes into effect as we globalise is that of \u201csuperstar economics\u201d: The argument that the best in any given field will earn disproportionately more than the second best in a globalised, technologically enabled set up. Nassim Nicholas Taleb describes this effect in his hugely insightful book \u201cThe Black Swan.\u201d The argument goes that a hundred years ago, a modestly talented footballer could earn a good living as local people would be willing to pay to see them play. Nowadays, everyone can tune in to Barcelona v Real Madrid to watch the best in the world. This crowds the averagely talented player out of the market, while grossly inflating Christiano Ronaldo\u2019s pay, as his audience grows exponentially.\u21b5\u21b5The sectors that have become less equal are the same ones that are growing the quickest. Urbanisation and industrialisation (particularly in the developing world) mean that more and more people are working in a winner-takes-most \u201cextremistan\u201d environment. In an argument first put forward by Simon Kuznets in\u24231955, this sectoral change in itself has become a driver for increased inequality.\u21b5\u21b5One of the most headline-friendly modes of discussion of inequality is around CEO compensation. There is ample evidence of CEO pay mushrooming in the last thirty years, with a growth rate\u2423127 times greater than the US industrial average since\u24231978. This idea of superstar economics goes a good way to explaining why: Intuitively, CEOs run much larger organisations.

visceral leishmaniasis (IVL), which is a public health problem in Algeria, is almost unknown in the cities of Western part of the country. The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiological, clinical, biological, therapeutic, and evolutionary aspects of IVL in Western Algeria, to evaluate the performance of the immunochromatography as a rapid diagnostic test of the disease, and to propose a diagnosis approach by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from the serum. This prospective study was performed on\u242363 suspicious cases of visceral leishmaniasis collected from the infectious diseases department at the Pediatric Hospital of Oran from January\u24232012 to July\u24232017. For each patient, the epidemiological parameters, and the clinical and biological data were collected. Bone marrow and blood samples were drawn from all cases. Bone marrow was performed to research amastigote forms of Leishmania and to identify the species by PCR-sequencing. Blood samples were used to detect anti-Leishmania antibodies as well as parasite DNA. Patients from the Western regions were mostly from rural areas. Sensitivity of RT-PCR from the bone marrow and from serum was\u242395.45% and\u242394.44%, respectively. The immunochromatography allowed the disease\u2019s diagnosis for\u242311 cases whose myelogram did not confirm the presence of the amastigote forms of Leishmania. Immunochromatography was revealed to be a good technique for disease diagnosis regarding the strongly evocative clinical signs. The results also suggest the interest of the RT-PCR assay from patient serum as a non-invasive sample, in the detection of parasite DNA.\u21b5LA eng\u21b5UL\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 2.297**\\n```\\n# \ufffd\ufffd\u5178\u7f51\u7edc\u5185\u7f51\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e92\u901a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5 {#concept_fnt_kch_ffb .concept<<}\u21b5\u21b5>>\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u662f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u9632\u706b\u5899\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u8981\u9075\u5faa\u6700\u5c0f\u6388\u6743\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4e0b\u9762\u4ecb\u7ecd\u56db\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5185\u7f51\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e92\u901a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u21b5\u21b5## \u65b9\u6cd5\u24231. \u4f7f\u7528\u5355 IP \ufffd\ufffd\u5740\u6388\u6743 {#section_gdp_wch_ffb .section}\u21b5\u21b5-  \u2423\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u5185\u7f51\u4e92\u901a\u573a\u666f\u3002\u21b5-  \u2423\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\u4ee5IP\u5730\u5740\u65b9\u5f0f\u6388\u6743\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u89c4\u5219\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u21b5-   \ufffd\ufffd\u70b9\uff1a\u5185\u7f51\u4e92\u901a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u591a\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u89c4\u5219\u6761\u6570\u2423100 \ufffd\ufffd\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u540e\u671f\u7ef4\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5927\u3002\u21b5-   \u8bbe\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u21b5   \u24231.\u2423\u2423\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u4e92\u901a\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165**\u672c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4**\u3002\u21b5   \u24232.\u2423\u2423\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u914d\u7f6e\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\uff0c\u5355\u51fb**\u914d\u7f6e\u89c4\u5219**\u3002\u21b5   <<\u2423>>3.\u2423 \ufffd\ufffd\u51fb**\u5185\u7f51\u5165\u65b9\u5411**\uff0c\u5e76\u5355\u51fb**\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u89c4\u5219**\u3002\u21b5   \u24234.\u2423 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u4ee5\u4e0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u21b5        -

It is my pleasure to serve as chamber president, to have owned a business in Forest Hills and to be a life-long resident here. I understand what it is like to run your own company and I know what the challenges that being self-employed entails. My mother opened a children\u2019s clothing store in the\u24231980\u2019s selling unique often handmade clothing. The store turned into a second generation owned business when I became involved in the\u24231990\u2019s. We sold our store in early\u24232004 and I am proud to say that today it is still a family run children\u2019s store on Austin Street! Through the decades of being in business I watched generations grow and I really felt part of the families here. And I still do today.\u21b5\u21b5The Forest Hills Chamber offers the opportunity to network with over\u2423230 Forest Hills based business owners and to get to know the people living and working in our community. I think of our members as being part of the fabric of Forest Hills and what I call the\u24233 C\u2019S: Commerce, Community & Culture. Commerce makes the community thrive and culture brings the community together.\u21b5\u21b5The Forest Hills Chamber Of Commerce wants to network with you!\u21b5\u21b5Question:\u21b5\u21b5How valuable is it to be able to network with Forest Hills Chamber members, tell them about your great business and reach their employees so they know about your business too?\u21b5\u21b5Answer<<:\u21b5\u21b5>>It is invaluable!

Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns.

In fact<<,>> society has reached a point at which saying<< \u201c>><<I>><<\u2019m>> so busy!\u201d is the standard<< response>> and has even become a kind of badge or symbol of importance \u2014 \u201c<<Of>> course I\u2019m busy; I\u2019m important!\u201d This is not a healthy trend, especially considering how an emphasis on being \u201cbusy\u201d has trickled down from company leadership to general staff. Today, all levels are displaying this behavior: Employees who rank lower and earn less are just as fixated as executives on staying busy \u2014 or at least appearing to be.\u21b5\u21b5There is some science behind this observation: A March\u24232017 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research looked at how signaling busyness in the workplace impacts one\u2019s status. The researchers found that in the United States, having leisure time is actually no longer considered prestigious. Instead, that kind of status is achieved only when people are perceived as being overworked and constantly busy.\u21b5\u21b5Clearly, leaders and employees alike need to rethink this mentality.\u21b5\u21b5The fallacy of praising \u201cbusyness\u201d\u21b5\u21b5If a company\u2019s culture is plagued with this rewriting of what constitutes status, that organization will suffer. The reason: There are implications for a company culture when its people are obsessed with being busy.\u21b5\u21b5For instance, employees may become run down. Job satisfaction may drop. Turnover may rise. Absenteeism may increase. And, despite the appearance that work is getting done, overall productivity and performance will suffer.\u21b5\u21b5Let\u2019s look at the specifics of what valuing busyness really says about a company\u2019s culture:\u21b5\u21b5Being overworked is rewarded.\u21b5\u21b5For a long time, people who have worked overtime have been viewed as valuable employees. Because of this, people who work long hours are rewarded with promotions and higher pay. But think about the last person at your company who earned a promotion. What was his or her typical day like? Did managers see this individual working late and think, \u201cThat\u2019s a great team player\u201d?\u21b5\u21b5Did all those extra hours of work earn this person points toward management\u2019s decision to promote him/her?\u21b5\u21b5Chances are, the answer is yes. While logically it makes sense to reward those who work the hardest, this scenario can lead employees to unnecessarily work themselves to the bone. A Staples\u24232016 study reflected this risk\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 10.812**\\n```\\nSlang\u21b5\u21b5Slang are words that are informal. Usually each generation or social group has its own slang - for example, older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people. On the other hand, younger people often understand, but find silly or old-fashioned, the slang of older people.\u21b5\u21b5Over time, language tends to get more complex, since new words enter much faster than old words leave. Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all.\u21b5\u21b5It has also happened that some words used in Anglo-Saxon for bodily functions became thought of as profanity or rude after they were replaced by Latinate words like \\\"urinate\\\", \\\"defecate\\\" and \\\"copulate\\\" - which polite people were supposed to use after the Norman conquest of England in\u24231066. This was in part a way of making poor people (who spoke Anglo-Saxon) all appear to be rude, while more powerful people (who spoke Norman) appeared to be polite - one way that etiquette can develop, and reinforce power structure. This is only one example from history of how racism can be a reason for defining one group's language as 'slang' and another as 'correct'.\u21b5\u21b5Wanting to have rules of grammar that do not change and the same vocabulary used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group's language as correct.\u21b5\u21b5An \\\"idiom\\\" can be slang, but it can also be a metaphor that becomes part of the culture.\u21b5\u21b5Two examples of slang are 'wassup' and 'dunnoe'. 'W<<ass>><<up>>' usually means<< '>><<What>><< is>><< up>>?' (as in<<,>><< '>><<How>><< are>><< you>><<?>>'), and 'dunnoe' usually means 'I don't know'.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 10.812**\\n```\\nHey, how are things?
