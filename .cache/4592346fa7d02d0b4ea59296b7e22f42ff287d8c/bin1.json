While there are many philosophical, religious, and scientific explanations for what life means, the meaning of life has also been shaped by culture, psychology, sociology, and other factors. Here are\u242325 distinct viewpoints on the meaning of life from various perspectives<<:\u21b5>>1. Scientific explanation: There are many scientific theories about the meaning of life, including Darwinism, biology, physics, and chemistry. Each theory proposes different interpretations of the universe and its inhabitants, and each offers insights into the origins of life, consciousness, and knowledge.\u21b52. Personal meaning: Some people believe that the meaning of life is subjective and individual, and serves as an opportunity to discover oneself and understand the world around us. Others believe that the meaning of life is determined by our own actions and choices.\u21b53. Existential meaning: Many people believe that the meaning of life is tied to personal experiences, emotions, and desires. They argue that these factors shape the meaning of life and offer opportunities for growth and fulfillment.\u21b54. Euclidean geometry: Euclid argues that the meaning of life is found in infinite possibilities, which may include human lives and natural environments.\u21b55. Systems theory: In systems theory, the meaning of life is based on principles of complexity, adaptability, and order. This perspective suggests that the meaning of life can be understood through the study of systems and how they work.\u21b56. Evolutionary theory: Evolutionary theory proposes that the meaning of life is predetermined and follows a specific pattern of development and change. It suggests that the meaning of life is highly dependent on the interactions between organisms and the environment.\u21b57. Life purpose: Life purpose refers to the belief that each person has a unique purpose and destiny, and that the purpose of life is not necessarily fixed but rather emerges from the choices we make and events that unfold throughout our lives.\u21b58. Individual responsibility: Individual responsibility refers to the belief that the meaning of life is related to the fulfillment of personal goals and objectives. This philosophy emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and decisions, and encourages individuals to pursue their passions and dreams.\u21b59. Ecological theory: Ecology is the study of the impact of human activity on the environment and the creation of the world around\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 2.250**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5write me a complete fantasy novel<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>><<\u21b5\u21b5>><<I>>'d be happy to help you with your fantasy novel<<!>> However, I must<< point>> out that creating a complete novel is a complex and time-consuming task that requires a lot of effort and expertise.

It is the foundation for our current understanding of particles and their interactions. QFT encompasses a wide range of theories, including quantum electrodynamics (QED), quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and the electroweak theory, which together form the Standard Model of particle physics.\u21b5\u21b5In QFT, particles are not described as point-like objects, but rather as excitations or quanta of underlying fields. These fields permeate the entire universe and can have various properties, such as mass, charge, and spin. The quanta of a field are called bosons, while the particles are called fermions.\u21b5\u21b5Here are some key concepts in QFT:\u21b5\u21b51. Fields: In QFT, particles are represented as excitations or quanta of underlying fields. These fields can be scalar fields (having a value at every point in space), vector fields (having a value and a direction at every point in space), or tensor fields (having a value and a direction at every point in space, as well as a rank, e.g.,\u24231,\u24232, or\u24233). The Higgs field, which gives particles mass, is an example of a scalar field, while the electromagnetic field is a vector field.\u21b52. Lagrangian: A Lagrangian is a mathematical function that describes the dynamics of a system. In QFT, the Lagrangian contains terms that represent the interactions between fields, as well as terms that describe the self-interactions of the fields. The Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the free energy of the system and the kinetic energy of the fields.\u21b53. Path integral formulation: This is an alternative approach to describing quantum systems, introduced by NAME_1. The path integral formulation of QFT involves considering all possible paths that a particle can take between two points and summing the amplitudes of these paths. This method allows for the evaluation of quantum mechanical averages and is mathematically equivalent to the standard QFT framework.\u21b54. Feynman diagrams: These are simple visual representations used to describe the various interactions between particles and fields. Feynman diagrams help physicists calculate the probability of specific interactions occurring and the likelihood of various outcomes.\u21b55.

All citizens would have health insurance coverage and access to care. Out-of-pocket costs for patients would be minimal. Private health insurance could still exist to provide additional coverage. The system would aim to provide basic care for all at an affordable cost, with additional private insurance for those who want extra coverage. \u21b5\u21b5Infrastructure: There would be a mix of public and private hospitals and clinics. Preventive care and primary care would be emphasized, with a focus on community health centers. There would be a robust network of doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals, with an emphasis on team-based care. Electronic health records would be widely used to enable care coordination. Strict controls would aim to eliminate waste and inefficiency. Core metrics would track health outcomes, cost, and patient satisfaction.\u21b5\u21b5Patient care: All citizens would have access to a basic package of benefits including primary care, hospital care, mental health services, maternity care, and more. Co-pays and out-of-pocket costs would be minimal. Choice of doctors and hospitals would aim to be maximized. There would be an emphasis on preventive care, health education, and managing chronic conditions to improve community health. Palliative care and end-of-life care would also be covered. \u21b5\u21b5The overall goal would be providing universal, affordable coverage and high-quality care for all citizens. By drawing on successful models from other nations, a balanced public-private system could be created meeting the core principles of universality, equity, and low cost. Private options could still thrive for those wanting additional coverage. But at its core, it would aim to provide basic, high-quality care for all citizens as a fundamental human right.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 2.156**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5generate a high detail writing book about how to make games on ubuntu with examples<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>><<\u21b5\u21b5>>Sure, here's<< a>> high-detail book on how to make games on Ubuntu with examples<<:\u21b5\u21b5>>Introduction\u21b5------------\u21b5\u21b5Ubuntu is a popular Linux distribution that is widely used for gaming.

State the problems and recommend step-by-step strategic solutions that businesses can use to mitigate them, so that they can increase their profit margins.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>>\u21b5Environmental sustainability in supply chains has become an increasingly important topic in recent years, as businesses and consumers alike have become more aware of the impact that their actions have on the planet. The supply chain refers to the network of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in producing and delivering a product or service, and it can have a significant impact on the environment.\u21b5\u21b5There are several problems that can arise in the supply chain that can have negative environmental consequences. One of the biggest issues is the use of fossil fuels, which can lead to greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change. The transportation of goods and materials can also have a negative impact on the environment, as it can lead to air pollution and the depletion of natural resources. Additionally, the production and disposal of packaging materials can contribute to waste and pollution.\u21b5\u21b5To mitigate these problems, businesses can take several strategic steps to increase their environmental sustainability. One of the first steps is to conduct a thorough environmental assessment of the supply chain, to identify areas where improvements can be made. This can include assessing the carbon footprint of the supply chain, as well as identifying areas where waste can be reduced or materials can be sourced more sustainably.\u21b5\u21b5Once areas for improvement have been identified, businesses can implement strategies to address them. One of the most effective ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels is to switch to alternative energy sources, such as solar or wind power. This can not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it can also save businesses money on energy costs.\u21b5\u21b5Another effective strategy is to optimize the transportation of goods and materials, to reduce the carbon footprint of the supply chain. This can include implementing more efficient shipping routes, using alternative modes of transportation, such as rail or sea, and reducing the weight and volume of products and packaging materials.\u21b5\u21b5In addition to reducing the use of fossil fuels, businesses can also work to reduce waste and pollution by implementing sustainable packaging practices. This can include using recycled materials for packaging, reducing the amount of packaging used, and finding ways to recycle or repurpose packaging materials.\u21b5\u21b5Finally, businesses can work to source materials more sustainably, by using suppliers who are committed to environmentally friendly practices.

State the problems and recommend methodical but strategic solutions that businesses can use to mitigate and improve upon the topic, so that their profit margins increase.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>>\u21b5Global supply chain management is a crucial aspect of modern business operations, as it involves the coordination and management of all activities involved in the production and delivery of goods and services across international borders. Effective global supply chain management can help businesses to improve their efficiency, reduce costs, and increase their competitiveness in the global market. However, there are also many challenges that businesses must overcome in order to successfully manage their global supply chains.\u21b5\u21b5One of the main challenges of global supply chain management is the complexity of coordinating activities across multiple countries and time zones. This can be especially difficult for businesses that are trying to manage large and complex supply chains with many different suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. In order to overcome this challenge, businesses must invest in robust supply chain management software and systems that can help them to track and manage their supply chain activities in real-time. This can help them to identify potential bottlenecks and issues before they become major problems, and to make adjustments to their supply chain as needed.\u21b5\u21b5Another major challenge of global supply chain management is the risk of supply chain disruptions, such as transportation delays, supplier failures, and natural disasters. These disruptions can have a significant impact on the ability of businesses to meet customer demand and maintain their profit margins. To mitigate this risk, businesses must develop contingency plans and redundancies in their supply chain. This can include diversifying their supplier base, maintaining inventory levels, and having alternative transportation routes in place.\u21b5\u21b5A third challenge of global supply chain management is the difficulty of managing and maintaining relationships with suppliers and other partners in different countries. This can be especially challenging for businesses that are trying to manage suppliers in countries with different languages, cultures, and legal systems. To overcome this challenge, businesses must invest in building strong relationships with their suppliers and other partners, and in developing a deep understanding of the local markets and regulations in which they operate. This can help them to identify potential risks and opportunities, and to make informed decisions about their supply chain operations.\u21b5\u21b5In addition to these challenges, there are also many opportunities for businesses to improve their global supply chain management practices. One of the most significant opportunities is the use of technology to automate and streamline supply chain activities.

Supply chains are the backbone of the global economy, and they have a significant impact on the environment through the production, transportation, and disposal of goods. In this article, we will explore the problems associated with environmental sustainability in supply chains and suggest strategic steps that businesses can take to address them.\u21b5\u21b5One of the key problems associated with environmental sustainability in supply chains is the production of greenhouse gas emissions. The manufacturing and transportation of goods can produce a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the production and transportation of goods are responsible for approximately\u242325% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To address this problem, businesses can take the following strategic steps:\u21b5\u21b51. Implement energy-efficient practices: One of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to implement energy-efficient practices in the production and transportation of goods. This can include the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies, such as LED lighting or energy-efficient machinery.\u21b52. Increase the use of sustainable materials: Another way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to increase the use of sustainable materials in the production of goods. This can include the use of recycled materials or materials that are sourced from sustainable forests or other sustainable sources.\u21b53. Optimize supply chain routes: Optimizing supply chain routes can also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can include the use of more efficient transportation routes or the consolidation of shipments to reduce the number of trips required.\u21b54. Engage in carbon offsetting: Carbon offsetting involves funding projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reforestation or renewable energy projects. This can help businesses to offset their own greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change.\u21b55.

Make it explain a complex topic in a very easy to read way. Ensure this is written so that it reads like it was written like a human.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>>\u21b5Blogging is a great way to promote and grow your business. If you have a blog, you can increase your audience, drive website traffic, build a community, and establish yourself as an expert in your field. Here are some basic tips for starting a business blog:\u21b51. Select a Focus: First, decide what you want to write about. Think about your interests, your industry, and your audience and choose a topic that will appeal to them. When in doubt, you can always start with something general, such as your business, your expertise, or a related area that you know a lot about.\u21b52. Choose a Platform: Next, choose a platform for your blog. A blog is basically a website, so you can create your blog on any website platform or content management system (CMS). Popular blogging platforms include WordPress, Blogger, and Squarespace.\u21b5Most website platforms and content management systems come with blogging software that\u2019s easy to use. If you\u2019re not tech-savvy, you can start with a popular blogging platform or CMS and get the help of a web designer to customize your blog, using a website template or theme. You can also get a blog with a website and hosting package, such as WordPress hosting from Bluehost.\u21b53. Set Up Your Blog: Once you\u2019ve selected a platform, set up your blog with your website host or provider and get your blog up and running.\u21b54. Add Content: Once your blog is set up and ready to go, add relevant content and publish it regularly. You can start by writing one blog post each week and gradually increase your posting schedule, depending on your time and resources.\u21b55. Maintain Your Blog: Once your blog is up and running, you need to maintain and promote it to make it successful. For example, you can include social sharing buttons to encourage readers to share your content, and you can also promote your blog through social media. You can also improve your blog by making it more visually appealing, for example, adding custom images and infographics.\u21b5A blog is a great way to showcase your expertise, build relationships, and increase your online presence.

Thaxton said the truck is not worn out, it's just outdated and no longer used to fight fires.\u21b5\u21b5Thaxton said the fire engine was not purchased with tax money because the county did not operate the fire department when the truck was bought. Instead, it belonged to the private corporation that ran the department, he said.\u21b5\u21b5Before\u24231977, Oconee County residents paid membership dues to get fire protection from the private fire department, according to Thaxton.\u21b5\u21b5He said if you were not a member and your house caught fire, a truck was not coming to snuff it out.\u21b5\u21b5When the county started running the department, it used the truck until it became outdated. Thaxton said the county has tried to sell the truck in the past without any bidders coming forward.\u21b5\u21b5The fire department will pick the winner of the truck raffle at its Halloween party, set for\u24238 p.m. Oct.\u242330 at Fire Station\u24231,\u24237580 Macon Highway, Watkinsville. Tickets are $5, and most firefighters carry a stack of tickets with them wherever they go.\u21b5\u21b5Thaxton said the winner receives the truck and can do whatever he or she wants to do with it. He said some people he has sold tickets to said they would use it as their own personal vehicle, while others said they would keep it for a year and return it to the fire department so they can repeat the fund-raiser in the future.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.094**\\n```\\n1945 Wiley Wildcats football team\u21b5\u21b5The\u24231945 Wiley Wildcats football team was an American football team that represented Wiley College in the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) during the\u24231945 college football season.

He was very active in the local community and was a leader of the relief effort following devastating floods in\u2423<<1>>915. He formed the Mukti Sangha, a welfare organization, after becoming inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. Datta's relief work continued up to the Bengal Famine of\u24231943.

The mines seem to have been exhausted in the seventeenth century ; at any rate, the prospecting, which has been spasmodically carried on during the last two centuries, has proved almost abortive<<.>> With the exception of the Koh-i-nor, all the large Indian diamonds were probably discovered not long before Tavernier\u2019s visit.

Small stones were detected by the miners in the gold washings at Tejuco, about eighty miles (129 km.) from Rio de Janeiro, in the Serro do Frio district of the State of Minas Geraes. The discovery naturally caused great excitement. So many diamonds were found that in\u24231727 something like a slump took place in their value. In order to keep up prices, the Dutch merchants, who mainly controlled the Indian output, asserted that the diamonds had not been found in Brazil at all, but were inferior Indian stones shipped to Brazil from Goa.

He was an Australian cultural icon and one of the country's most awarded stars, with a career spanning nearly seven decades and producing numerous recordings. He was known to record songs in the legacy of Australia, particularly of bush life and renowned Australian bush poets Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson that represented the lifestyle. The music genre was coined the \\\"bush ballad\\\", a style first made popular by Buddy Williams, the first artist to perform the genre in Australia, and also for his many trucking songs.\u21b5\u21b5Dusty was the first Australian to have a No.\u24231 international hit song, with a version of Gordon Parsons' \\\"A Pub with No Beer\\\". He received an unequalled\u242337 Golden Guitar and two Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) awards and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and Australian Roll of Renown. At the time of his death, at the age of\u242376, Dusty had been working on his\u2423106th album for EMI Records. In\u24232007, his domestic record sales in Australia surpassed seven million.

She was a plain grey beetle who\u21b5looked just like all the other beetles of her kind. This saddened her a\u21b5great deal for she knew in her heart that she was a special and unique\u21b5beetle. There was no one else quite like her. Every day she would go\u21b5about her daily chores thinking of a way to make herself known. She\u21b5wanted to be rewarded for things that she did. She was tired of the\u21b5whole colony getting rewarded by the queen for the work that she\u2019d done.\u21b5But how can I get credit when the queen cannot tell me apart from anyone else? She\u21b5was also sick and tired of being treated as though there was nothing\u21b5special about her. She thought about this a great deal. Frustrated, she\u21b5left the colony in search of an answer.\u21b5It was a very hot day\u21b5and the little beetle was becoming thirsty. Sensing that there was\u21b5water off to her right somewhere, she moved off the worn path. She\u21b5crawled through a tall patch of grass and saw the most beautiful lake\u21b5that she had ever seen. She didn\u2019t remember ever seeing this place\u21b5before, although she had walked that path many times. Hmmmm.\u21b5She looked all around at all the beautiful trees and flowers. There were\u21b5creatures of all different types and sizes. She did not see anyone else\u21b5like her. She slowly crept toward the lake and lowered her mouth to the\u21b5surface of the water for a drink. Ripples formed in the water from\u21b5where her antennas tapped the surface of the lake.\u21b5\u201cDelilah? Delilah? What is bothering you so my child?\u201d\u21b5Delilah cautiously looked up and around her. She didn\u2019t see whoever was\u21b5calling her. She returned to drinking water from the lake.\u21b5\u201cDelilah!\u201d\u21b5This time the voice startled her and she fell backwards onto the shore.\u21b5\u201cWho...who is there?\u201d Delilah asked afraid.\u21b5\u201cI Am who I Am. What is troubling you so dear daughter?\u201d\u21b5\u201cWhy do you call me your child, your daughter? My parents live back at the colony.

This has caused backlinks to be created to our site containing the partner string. I was wondering if these links would pass value to www.mysite.com/landingpage.html and the tracking parameters would be ignored or would Google treat www.mysite.com/landingpage.html?partner=123456 as its own page. If it did treat it as a seperate page, could you reclaim some of it using the canoncial tag?\u21b5\u21b52 Responses\u21b5\u21b5In addition to Lynns point it would be worth discounting these URL parameters in Google webmaster tools and bing in order to avoid any possible duplicate content issues, rather than leaving it to them to work out which will also avoid the case Lynn mentions for organic search (A case we also expoerienced with a client!)\u21b5\u21b5This is a good example of when to use the canonical tag.

I am designed to assist with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to generating text and performing language-related tasks. I am powered by natural language processing algorithms and machine learning models, which allow me to understand and respond to user input in a way that is natural and human-like.\u21b5\u21b5As for the relation between mathematics and philosophy, there has been a long-standing connection between the two fields dating back to ancient Greece. Many of the earliest philosophers, such as Pythagoras and NAME_1, were deeply interested in mathematics and saw it as a key to understanding the nature of reality. Over time, the relationship between mathematics and philosophy has evolved and taken on different forms, with some philosophers seeing mathematics as a language for describing the world, while others see it as a purely abstract and logical system.\u21b5\u21b5One area where the connection between mathematics and philosophy is particularly strong is in the philosophy of science. Many scientific theories rely heavily on mathematical models and concepts, and philosophers have long debated the relationship between these models and the empirical data they are meant to explain. Additionally, there are philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical objects and whether they exist independently of human thought or are simply constructions of the mind.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, the relationship between mathematics and philosophy is complex and multifaceted, with many different perspectives and approaches to understanding it.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 17.625**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5can you tell me a little bit about<< yourself>><<?>><|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5You can call me Vicuna, and I was trained by Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) researchers as a language model.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5Do you think?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5As a language model, I don't have the ability to think or feel in the same way that humans do.

Specifically, they use a type of machine learning called \\\"deep learning\\\" which involves training a network of artificial neurons to recognize patterns in the input data.\u21b5\u21b5The training process involves feeding the model vast amounts of text data, such as books, articles, and websites, and using this data to adjust the internal parameters of the model so that it can make better and better predictions.\u21b5\u21b5Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate text, translate languages, summarize text, or perform other natural language processing tasks.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5Does racism still exist?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5Racism is a complex and multifaceted issue that has existed throughout history and continues to exist in many forms today.\u21b5\u21b5Racism is the belief that one's own race is superior to others and it can manifest in many ways, such as discrimination, prejudice, stereotyping, and violence. Racism can be directed towards individuals or groups based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background.\u21b5\u21b5Although racism still exists, there have been significant efforts to combat it and promote equality and inclusivity.

It feels very old to me. Perhaps it is because I was married at\u242319. Perhaps it is because I have always felt older than I am. Perhaps it is because, I never had a period of time in my life that I was a wild rebel. Well, my grandma might beg to differ..... but I mean, wild in the ways of drinking, partying, all that stuff. Perhaps I feel old, because\u242326 is old, well to me. My husband, who is\u242317 years older than me, just rolls his eyes at me when I express just how old I feel. But, old or not,\u242326 is what I will be come monday. So, since I rarely post anything about<< myself>>,<< my>> two kids are much more interesting I assure you... I decided to post\u242326 things about<< me>>. Here goes...\u21b5\u21b51. I have never lived more than\u242330 minutes away from where I was born.\u21b5\u21b52. I went to bed with a jar of crayons rather than a stuffed animal when I was little.\u21b5\u21b53. I spent\u242316 years of my life as a tap dancer. I still teach a class every now and then.\u21b5\u21b54. I have never had a big dog, I have had lots of little ones though, Tia, Trinket, Tita, & Pearlene\u21b5\u21b55. I didn't get my drivers license until\u24231 month before Caillou was born.\u21b5\u21b56. My grandma is my best friend.\u21b5\u21b57. I don't like airplanes, spiders, scary movies, freeways, or snakes\u21b5\u21b58. I used to have my nose pierced.\u21b5\u21b59. My favorite color is yellow.\u21b5\u21b510. I am a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\u21b5\u21b511. I have an addiction to eating out, my grandma supports my addiction!\u21b5\u21b512. I am an only child, my grandma raised me.\u21b5\u21b513. My kindergarten boyfriend was Patrick Wheatcroft, we planned to be married at mcdonalds.\u21b5\u21b514. I am a night owl.\u21b5\u21b515. I have never worn high heel shoes a day in my life.\u21b5\u21b516. I was almost named Victoria Nichole, my nickname would have been vicky-nicky!\u21b5\u21b517.

I'm from Los Angeles, but have lived all over the world. I retired here to Stevens County in\u24232004. I've been involved with Colville Branch AAUW, Colville Horizons, was a VISTA with Rural Resources and am a public member of the Washington State Medical Quality Assurance Commission. I started to write true stories, frequently called creative non-fiction or narrative essays, for anthologies about five years ago, and have had over\u242360 published, with many more on the way. I keep the books between my \\\"A\\\" and \\\"Z\\\" bookends on top my entertainment center. Soon I'll be running out of room and have to find another place to display them. I have a couple of books coming out this month with some of my stories. Winter has a story called \\\"Tombstone Territory,\\\" and Life Lessons from Moms has \\\"Tea for Two.\u201d I\u2019ll be signing copies of these books and some Chicken Soup for the Soul books to the Libraries of Stevens County Foundation Book Fair Fundraiser at the Chewelah Country Club on May\u242312! Apart from writing, what do you do? Read, travel, take care of two dogs and three cats, watch British comedies and mysteries on Netflix, and go to plays, museums and libraries. I also belong to two book groups, and am active with a number of organizations. I'm also the co-creator of three new anthologies for the new Not Your Mother's Book anthology series. My titles are On Travel, Sharing Secrets and The First Time. Submission guidelines for these stories can be found online here: http://publishingsyndicate.com/publishing_syndicate/submissions/nymb_sub... does your inspiration come from? Everyday incidents, reflecting on my childhood and my relationships. I also look for call outs for submissions. Often just seeing a title of a proposed anthology will bring a story to mind.Who has been most influential in your craft? I've never tried to emulate another writer. Because I started writing so young, I think I've always had my own voice. It gets stronger and probably more persistent as I age. If I were to write fiction, I might take a tip or two from F. Scott Fitzgerald, though, when it comes to constructing a story. He never wastes a word. I think The Great Gatsby is the most marvelously assembled novel ever,\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 17.500**\\n```\\nPhysics in Lanham Seabrook\u21b5\u21b5213\u21b5Lanham Seabrook physics tutors\u21b5\u21b5Find the best physics tutor in Lanham Seabrook\u21b5\u21b5Sort by:\u21b5\u21b5Dedra D.\u21b5\u21b575hr\u21b5\u21b575/per hour\u21b5\u21b5Silver Spring, MD\u21b5\u21b5STEM education specialist, PhD Physics, Long-time professor\u21b5\u21b5I have nine years of experience as a college professor teaching and tutoring introductory physics and mathematical methods, with over\u242316 total years of teaching and tutoring students from middle school through adulthood.

In an effort to educate Bellevue residents, the candidates were given the opportunity to answer five basic questions regarding<< their>> campaign.\u21b5\u21b5Below are the responses from Candidate Jon Soyring.\u21b5\u21b5Question #1: Can You Tell Us<< About>><< Yourself>><<?\u21b5>>My name is Jon Soyring. Previously, I ran for Wisconsin State Senate (2010). I served honorably as a (Desert Storm Era) U.S. Naval Hospital Corpsman. My wife Toni and I have been married for\u242322 years, and have lived in Bellevue since\u24232002. We own a home in the Merry Creek Subdivision and have operated our business on Bellevue Street since\u24232002. My wife and I like to do \u201cspur of the moment\u201d traveling with no real destination. Our best vacations were the ones we never planned; just pack a bag flip a coin, and go where the road takes us. We like to \u201cPay it Forward\u201d. We do charitable acts anonymously. Every now and then we might pay for some random person\u2019s meal at a restaurant, or their tank of gasoline. We like to bring a smile to their face. I\u2019m a Great Lakes Historian of sorts. Primarily focused on the shipwreck of the EDMUND FITZGERALD. I have researched the tragedy for\u242336 years, lectured on the topic, and wrote a movie script depicting the events that lead to its demise. I have accumulated one of the largest collections of Fitzgerald information known to be held in private hands.\u21b5\u21b5Question #2: Why are you running for municipal office?\u21b5I am running for office because I am committed to the preservation of Bellevue\u2019s highly coveted, LOW TAX BURDEN. It is because of Bellevue\u2019s reputation of being \u201cThe Taxpayer\u2019s Haven\u201d; that we continue to see positive growth (albeit slower growth) in this down-turned economy.\u21b5\u21b5I would like to champion and promote the village in positive ways to encourage businesses and families to choose Bellevue as their home; to bring the community closer together through volunteerism and a sense of community; Neighbor helping neighbor.
