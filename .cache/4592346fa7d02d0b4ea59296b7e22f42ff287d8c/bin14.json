Your task is to look at the text examples where this feature activates most strongly and determine what pattern it detects and classify it as one of three types: entity, behavior, or semantic.\\n\\n## Top Activating Examples\\n\\nBelow are text sequences where this feature activated most strongly. In each example:\\n- **Score** shows the activation strength\\n- Text is shown with the most strongly activating tokens marked with <<double angle brackets>>\\n\\nKeep in mind that these are the top activating samples out of roughly 500,000 total samples. Thus, pay more attention to the content of the text, rather than the specific tokens that are lighting up within those texts (although this can be helpful for interpretation as well).\\n\\n### Chat/Instruction Examples\\n**Example 1 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 10.812**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5<<Draw>><< a>><< ko>><<ala>><<<|start_header_id|>>>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Sure, here's a simple<< diagram>><< of>><< a>><< ko>><<ala>>:\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5```scss\u21b5     +------------+\u21b5     |    << Body>>   |\u21b5     +------------+\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 8.000**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5What can<< I>><< do>><< in>><< NYC>> iF<< I>><< only>><< have>><<\u2423>><<2>>mor\u24233<< days>><<<|start_header_id|>>>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5There are plenty of things to do<< in>><< New>><< York>> City in just\u24232 or\u24233 days!

Virtue theory serves primarily as a framework for understanding deficits\u2014Ego deficits if you will\u2014in particular patients, and provides an additional framework\u2014particularly in conjunction family systems ideas\u2014for understanding how those deficits in virtue emerged over the developmental history of the client. Most psychotherapies could operate within this framework, particularly behavioural, cognitive-behavioural, interpersonal, family and some forms of psychodynamic approaches. That being said, I also believe that virtue theory has direct application to assessment/treatment, and I have been experimenting with this approach with certain clients. Of course, it is important in therapy that the client or clients understand and agree with the therapeutic rationale. As with all psychotherapy, the addition of the virtue approach requires that the therapist and client(s) cocreate new narratives with input from the client. \u21b5Let me illustrate therapeutic application with regard to the client described above. First, I should note that my therapeutic approach is Integrated Eclecticism, a theoretical position widely recognized in the US psychotherapy literature. This approach implies that I might use a variety of psychotherapies (cognitivebehavioural, behavioural, object relations, interpersonal) with a particular client, depending on my clinical judgment of client needs. With the client described above, early in treatment I used cognitive restructuring to deal with depressive and anxiety-provoking cognitions he was experiencing. I also employed family systems to deal with over involvement on his parents\u2019 part. Later sessions have employed other cognitive-behavioural elements including problem solving, \u2018the pie technique\u2019, and imagery. On occasion, I have done role play with the client when dealing with anxiety about job applications and such.\u21b5<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>It sounds like you are suggesting that virtue theory can serve as a framework for understanding deficits in virtue in clients, and that it can be used in conjunction with other psychotherapeutic approaches to help clients develop virtues and work towards becoming better versions of themselves.

Does lowering the resistance (chrome extension available right in your browser) favor over having to download, install and run a software on one&#x27;s computer (binary file)?\u21b5======\u21b5sigvef<<\u21b5>>It really depends on what the tool is going to do. Unless the tool is\u21b5intimately related to Chrome in some way (tab manager, page screenshotter, or\u21b5something else that needs to access Chrome in some way), and I'm assuming its\u21b5not, since stand-alone is an option, I'd question why anything needs to be\u21b5installed at all, even as a Chrome extension.\u21b5\u21b5I'd much rather visit pdf2gif.io (random example) than use something that\u21b5needs to be installed, when possible.\u21b5\u21b5------\u21b5drvortex<<\u21b5>>The only advantage you would get with a Chrome extension is distribution\u21b5platform (Web store).

It is only later that we are benchmarking old\u21b5machines to understand the performance gaps, and if you weren't there, you\u21b5might think this was relevant at the time.\u21b5\u21b5Generally, in the mid\u242380s, you needed base performance (8088/8086) or \\\"3 times\u21b5as fast\\\" performance (80286) when the AT came about. Compaq (now HP) became\u21b5the real competitor to IBM PC/XT because the end user could understand that\u21b5they ran at\u24238 MHz vs the PC\u24234.77 Mhz. This is as much performance issues that\u21b5the users would want to know. Better performance without needing to buy an AT.\u21b5Then the clones came about, and everybody started to put a \\\"turbo\\\" button on\u21b5front of the clone PC.\u21b5\u21b5My first degree was in finance and accounting, but I fell in love with\u21b5technology, so I sold PCs out of the biggest gray marketer in Seattle when the\u21b5PC AT (second real computer for business) was coming out. I have first hand\u21b5knowledge of the buying behavior because I was on the front lines of computer\u21b5sales, and made a ton of good money selling $2-5K computers to people walking\u21b5in off the street.\u21b5\u21b5The advent of the PC revolution was all about apps. I'm not saying that there\u21b5weren't benchmarks, and maybe you'd find a savvy buyer that subscribed to Byte\u21b5magazine, but these were far and few between. Tandy simply didn't have Lotus\u21b51-2-3. The PC Junior wasn't a performance issue, but the term \\\"Junior\\\" just\u21b5killed the thing out of the gate. The investment in a PC was a lot of money,\u21b5and you weren't going to get a Junior, you were going to get a real PC.
