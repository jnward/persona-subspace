Thus, pay more attention to the content of the text, rather than the specific tokens that are lighting up within those texts (although this can be helpful for interpretation as well).\\n\\n### Chat/Instruction Examples\\n**Example 1 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 10.812**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5<<Draw>><< a>><< ko>><<ala>><<<|start_header_id|>>>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Sure, here's a simple<< diagram>><< of>><< a>><< ko>><<ala>>:\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5```scss\u21b5     +------------+\u21b5     |    << Body>>   |\u21b5     +------------+\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\u21b5          |\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 8.000**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5What can<< I>><< do>><< in>><< NYC>> iF<< I>><< only>><< have>><<\u2423>><<2>>mor\u24233<< days>><<<|start_header_id|>>>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5There are plenty of things to do<< in>><< New>><< York>> City in just\u24232 or\u24233 days!

Virtue theory serves primarily as a framework for understanding deficits\u2014Ego deficits if you will\u2014in particular patients, and provides an additional framework\u2014particularly in conjunction family systems ideas\u2014for understanding how those deficits in virtue emerged over the developmental history of the client. Most psychotherapies could operate within this framework, particularly behavioural, cognitive-behavioural, interpersonal, family and some forms of psychodynamic approaches. That being said, I also believe that virtue theory has direct application to assessment/treatment, and I have been experimenting with this approach with certain clients. Of course, it is important in therapy that the client or clients understand and agree with the therapeutic rationale. As with all psychotherapy, the addition of the virtue approach requires that the therapist and client(s) cocreate new narratives with input from the client. \u21b5Let me illustrate therapeutic application with regard to the client described above. First, I should note that my therapeutic approach is Integrated Eclecticism, a theoretical position widely recognized in the US psychotherapy literature. This approach implies that I might use a variety of psychotherapies (cognitivebehavioural, behavioural, object relations, interpersonal) with a particular client, depending on my clinical judgment of client needs. With the client described above, early in treatment I used cognitive restructuring to deal with depressive and anxiety-provoking cognitions he was experiencing. I also employed family systems to deal with over involvement on his parents\u2019 part. Later sessions have employed other cognitive-behavioural elements including problem solving, \u2018the pie technique\u2019, and imagery. On occasion, I have done role play with the client when dealing with anxiety about job applications and such.\u21b5<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>It sounds like you are suggesting that virtue theory can serve as a framework for understanding deficits in virtue in clients, and that it can be used in conjunction with other psychotherapeutic approaches to help clients develop virtues and work towards becoming better versions of themselves.

However, on the negative real numbers, log-star is , whereas\u2423 for positive , so the two functions differ for negative arguments.\u21b5The iterated logarithm accepts any positive real number and yields an integer. Graphically, it can be understood as the number of \\\"zig-zags\\\" needed in Figure\u24231 to reach the interval\u2423 on the x-axis.\u21b5\u21b5In computer science,\u2423 is often used to indicate the binary iterated logarithm, which iterates the binary logarithm (with base ) instead of the natural logarithm (with base e). \u21b5\u21b5Mathematically, the iterated logarithm is well-defined for<< any>> base greater than , not only for base\u2423 and base e.\u21b5\u21b5Analysis of algorithms\u21b5The iterated logarithm is useful in analysis of algorithms and computational complexity, appearing in the time and space complexity bounds of some algorithms such as:\u21b5\u21b5 Finding the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points knowing the Euclidean minimum spanning tree: randomized O(n\\\\xa0\\\\xa0n) time\u21b5 F\u00fcrer's algorithm for integer multiplication: O(n\\\\xa0log\\\\xa0n\\\\xa02O(\\\\xa0n))\u21b5 Finding an approximate maximum (element at least as large as the median):\u2423\\\\xa0n \u2212\u24234 to\u2423\\\\xa0n +\u24232 parallel operations\u21b5 Richard Cole and Uzi Vishkin's distributed algorithm for\u24233-coloring an n-cycle: O(\\\\xa0n) synchronous communication rounds.\u21b5 Performing weighted quick-union with path compression \u21b5\u21b5The iterated logarithm grows at an extremely slow rate, much slower than the logarithm itself.

If insomnia is caused by a painful medical problem, successful treatment of the medical disorder will improve the insomnia as well. If depression is causing the insomnia, treatment of the depression will help resolve the insomnia.\u21b5\u21b5Changing the timing of medication administration may be important for resolving the insomnia. Ideally, stimulating medications should be taken early in the day, while sedating medications should be taken near bedtime.\u21b5\u21b5Some behavioral modification techniques have proven successful for the alleviation of psychophysiologic or primary insomnia. In a recent review by Morin et al.,\u242370% to\u242380% of patients with primary chronic insomnia benefited from nonpharmacologic treatments.\u21b5\u21b5Sleep hygiene is a set of guidelines aimed at maintaining healthy sleep habits. Commonsense rules include avoiding or limiting naps, particularly late in the day, as daytime napping may interfere with nighttime sleep; avoiding substances that interfere with sleep, such as alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine; maintaining a stable sleep-wake pattern throughout the week; and exercising regularly, but not late in the day (physical or mental stimulation at night may interfere with sleep). For a summary of sleep hygiene rules for the elderly,\u21b5\u21b5Stimulus control therapy is another behavioral technique designed to remove all negative associations from the bedroom environment.<< The>> patient is instructed<< to>> go to bed only when sleepy. If unable to fall asleep in\u242315 to\u242320 min<<,>> the patient must leave the bedroom and engage in a relaxing activity, such as reading a magazine or writing a letter. Only when patients feel sleepy again can they return to bed. This procedure should be re-peated as needed, until sleep is achieved in less than\u242315 min. For a summary of stimulus control therapy,\u21b5\u21b5. Stimulus control therapy is appropriate for patients who feel stress, tension, or anxiety that are conditioned to the bedroom or the bed. They are caught in a vicious cycle, in which negative thoughts and feelings disrupt their ability to fall asleep, leading to more intensified adverse thoughts and feelings associated with the bed-room.

Many insomniacs try to get more sleep by going to bed early and spending more time in bed, when in fact this only worsens the problem.

These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by stool, or directly from another person who is infected. A<< number>> of non-infectious causes may also result in diarrhea including: hyperthyroidism, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, a number of medications, and irritable bowel syndrome among others.\u21b5Prevention of infectious diarrhea is by improved sanitation, clean drinking water, and hand washing. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), which is clean water with modest amounts of salt and sugar, along with zinc tablets are often employed. In those<< with>> severe dehydration, intravenous fluids may be required.\u21b5About\u24231.7 to\u24235 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year.2 It is most common in developing countries were young children get diarrhea on average three times a year. Worldwide, as of\u24232012, it is the second most common cause of death in children less than five (0.76 million or\u242311%).3 Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those less than five years of age. Other long term problems that can result include poor physical and intellectual development.\u24232 See Diarrhoea: why children are still dying and what can be done, The United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization,\u24232009.3 See Diarrhoeal Disease Fact Sheet N\u00b0330, World Health Organization, April\u24232013.\u21b5Chronic diarrhea can be the part of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome and bile acid malabsorption.\u21b5While antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea, they are usually not used except in specific situations as some bacteria develop antibiotic resistance. Antibiotics themselves can also cause diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is the most common\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.203**\\n```\\nUser: *chuck Norris roundhouse kicks.\u21b5Cleverbot<<:>> You Can't Summon Chuck Norris!!\u21b5User: *shoots*.\u21b5Cleverbot: *cries*.\u21b5User: *kills*.\u21b5Cleverbot: *dies in your arms*.\u21b5or\u21b5Cleverbot: I'm a biped mammal as you are.\u21b5User: I have paws.\u21b5Cleverbot: Birds do not have paws.\u21b5User: Well I have.\u21b5Cleverbot: No, you have the opposite of.\u21b5User: What is the opposite of?\u21b5Cleverbot: Can you memorize things you are exposed to?\u21b5User: No.\u21b5Cleverbot: You are boring me.\u21b5User: That's what I want.\u21b5Cleverbot: I'm sure.\u21b5User: Yes.\u21b5Cleverbot: You like making me sad don't you.\u21b5User: You bet.\u21b5Cleverbot: That wasn't a compliment either.\u21b5User: How funny.\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes it is, isn't it?\u21b5User: Clownbot.\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes.\u21b5User: Good master.\u21b5Cleverbot: I am not your master.\u21b5User: Than I am your master.\u21b5Cleverbot: Right here, right now.\u21b5User: I command you to die right here, right now.\u21b5Cleverbot: My name is Cleverbot, master.\u21b5User: Your master commands you to die now please.\u21b5Cleverbot: I am cleverbot.\u21b5User: So you died?\u21b5Cleverbot: I planted some bulbs for the fall, hopefully they\u21b5will bloom this summer.\u21b5User: In summer you die?\u21b5Cleverbot: Sometimes.\u21b5User: Like now?\u21b5Cleverbot: No ...\u21b5User: Please?\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes.\u21b5User: So you died?\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes I did.\u21b5User: Are you dead?\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes.\u21b5User: Are you shore I killed you and you are dead?\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes.\u21b5User: Finnaly you died.\u21b5Cleverbot: You are alive!\u21b5User: You are dead.\u21b5Cleverbot: Oh really?\u21b5User: Yes.\u21b5Cleverbot: Why are you doing that?\u21b5User: So you die.\u21b5Cleverbot: Hope that you die.\u21b5User: I hope that you die too.\u21b5Cleverbot: I am.\u21b5User: Dead?\u21b5Cleverbot: Yes.\u21b5\u21b5HAWWO!

All chat examples have identical scores (44.000) and the activation occurs at the exact same structural position - the newline that begins the assistant's response.\\n\\nThe pretraining examples are more varied but seem to involve transitions, boundaries, or structural elements in text. Example 3 shows activation on \\\"I\\\" at the start of a new game/activity. Examples 4-6 show activations on common function words (\\\"The\\\", \\\"to\\\", \\\"raise\\\") that often mark transitions or new clauses. Example 7 shows activation on a colon after \\\"Cleverbot\\\" which marks a speaker transition. Example 8 activates on \\\"also\\\" which marks a transition to an alternative approach.\\n\\nThe common thread is that this feature detects structural boundaries or transitions in text - particularly the transition points where a new speaker, section, or conceptual unit begins. The chat examples show this most clearly with the assistant response boundaries, while the pretraining examples show it in various other transitional contexts.\\n\\nThis is a semantic feature because it's detecting an abstract linguistic pattern (structural boundaries/transitions) rather than specific entities or actions.
