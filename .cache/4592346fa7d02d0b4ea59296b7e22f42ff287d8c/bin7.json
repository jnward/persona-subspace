NAME_1 is from a non-magical family. He's shy and scared.

He had grown up in a non-magical family, and they had never talked about magic or witchcraft. They had simply lived their lives, trying to make ends meet.\u21b5\u21b5But now, NAME_1 was going to a school of witchcraft and wizardry, and he was both excited and scared. He had always dreamed of learning magic, but he wasn't sure if he was good enough. He was shy and didn't know anyone, and he was afraid of making mistakes.\u21b5\u21b5NAME_2, on the other hand, was a well-known wizard in the magical community. He came from a long line of powerful wizards, and everyone expected great things from him. He was confident and outgoing, and he loved to learn new spells and try new things.\u21b5\u21b5When NAME_1 and NAME_2 first arrived at the school, they were both assigned to Kirin House. They were both excited to be there, but they were also nervous. They didn't know anyone, and they didn't know what to expect.\u21b5\u21b5As they walked through the halls of the school, they couldn't help but notice the beautiful and mythical creatures that surrounded them. There were Kirin statues in the hallways, and Tanuki and Kitsune statues in the courtyards. The school was truly magical, and they were in awe of their surroundings.\u21b5\u21b5They arrived at their first class, and they were both introduced to their new professors. They learned about the history of magic, and they were shown the different types of spells that they would be learning. They were both eager to learn, and they were determined to do their best.\u21b5\u21b5As they walked back to their dormitory after their first day of classes, NAME_2 turned to NAME_1 and said, \\\"I really like\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.875**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Write a script dialogue between a\u242349 year old father and his\u242310 year old daughter living in\u242356 Strathmere Place Upper Kedron QLD, they just woke up on a Saturday morning and he wants to make sure that she doesn\u2019t play too many video games.

That means that every action we take, every thought we have, is predetermined by the laws of physics.\u21b5\u21b5NAME_2: I see what you mean, but I'm not sure I agree. I believe that we have the ability to make choices, to choose our own path in life.\u21b5\u21b5NAME_1: But isn't that just an illusion?

Some philosophers believe that we have the illusion of free will, and that our choices are actually predetermined by the physical laws of the universe. But others argue that our choices are genuinely free, and that we have the ability to make choices that are not predetermined by the physical world.\u21b5\u21b5NAME_2: That's definitely a heavy thought.

The fox hunt was initially a civilian endeavour that began when a pair of English foxhounds were imported to Gibraltar. The hunts took place across the border, in the Campo de Gibraltar area of Spain. However, in\u24231814, the membership of the Hunt underwent a substantial change. Many officers of the Gibraltar garrison joined the Hunt, which shifted from a civilian to a military enterprise. That year, the name was changed to the Civil Calpe Hunt. It retained that title until\u24231817, after which it was known as the Calpe Hunt. The first Master of the Hunt was Charles Elphinstone Fleeming. However, the Master most associated with the Hunt was Pablo Larios, Marquis of Marzales, who held that title for forty-five years. His election to that position in\u24231891 was not only historic, but strategic. His appointment represented only the second time that the position had not been filled by a member of the military. In addition, his Spanish heritage and influence in the Campo de Gibraltar, where he owned extensive estates, garnered him the loyalty of the local Spanish farmers, and therefore eased the ever-present tensions between the military and the farmers over the crop damage that was inherent to the Hunt. In\u24231906, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and King Alfonso XIII of Spain became joint Patrons of the Hunt, after which it was known as the Royal Calpe Hunt. The tradition of the Hunt continued for more than a century, until\u24231939, and the onset of the Second World War\u21b5\u21b5History\u21b5\u21b5Gibraltar, by then a British colony at the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, generally had few opportunities for outdoor recreational activities at the turn of the nineteenth century. In\u24231812, the Reverend Mackareth, the garrison chaplain and former chaplain to the Duke of Kent, imported with a colleague a pair of English foxhounds. The hounds were Rookwood and Ranter and, after their arrival, other civilians obtained hunting dogs. The huntsmen who started the pack formed a club, the Civil Hunt, whose members wore blue uniforms with<< silver>> buttons. The hunting took place in Spain, in the Campo de Gibraltar area of Andalusia, with the furthest hunts about fourteen miles from Gibraltar. The hunts started in November, after the first rains, and ended in March when the ground became\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.398**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Exposing hidden truncation-related errors in acute stroke perfusion imaging.\u21b5The durations of acute ischemic stroke patients' CT or MR perfusion scans may be too short to fully sample the passage of the injected contrast<< agent>> through the brain. We tested the potential magnitude of hidden errors related to the truncation of data by short perfusion scans. Fifty-seven patients with acute ischemic stroke underwent perfusion MR imaging within\u242312 hours of symptom onset, using a relatively long scan duration (110 seconds). Shorter scan durations (39.5-108.5 seconds) were simulated by progressively deleting the last-acquired images. CBV, CBF, MTT, and time to response function maximum (Tmax) were measured within DWI-identified acute infarcts, with commonly used postprocessing algorithms. All measurements except Tmax were normalized by dividing by the contralateral hemisphere values. The effects of the scan duration on these hemodynamic measurements and on the volumes of lesions with Tmax of >6 seconds were tested using regression. Decreasing scan duration from\u2423110 seconds to\u242340 seconds falsely reduced perfusion estimates by\u242347.6%-64.2% of normal for CBV,\u24231.96%-4.10% for CBF,\u2423133%-205% for MTT, and\u24236.2-8.0 seconds for Tmax, depending on the postprocessing method. This truncation falsely reduced estimated Tmax lesion volume by\u242371.5 or\u242393.8 mL, depending on the deconvolution method. \\\"Lesion reversal\\\" (ie, change from above-normal to apparently normal, or from >6 seconds to \u22646 seconds for the time to response function maximum) with increasing truncation occurred in\u242337%-46% of lesions for CBV,\u24232%-4% for CBF,\u242328%-54% for MTT, and\u242342%-44% for Tmax, depending on the postprocessing method. Hidden truncation-related errors in perfusion images may be large enough to alter patient management or affect outcomes of clinical trials.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.391**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Category Archives: Headlines\u21b5\u21b5A bicycle camp for disabled children and young adults is coming to Bloomington this August.

And today, IU indicated it would follow suit. IU president Michael McRobbie recommended in a statement today that IU not increase tuition for in-state students for the next two years. The IU Board of Trustees will make a final decision on that request June third. McRobbie\u2019s recommendation comes on the heels of Purdue Trustees approving a fourth year of a tuition freeze at that school. Purdue has frozen the rate of tuition since the\u24232012-2013 school year and plans on offering the same rate through the\u24232015-2016 academic year.\u21b5\u21b5A tuition freeze would be something of a change to IU\u2019s past approach. IU Spokesman Mark Land said yesterday that while IU has not offered an across-the-board tuition freeze recently, it has set a fixed rate for some students. There isn\u2019t a huge difference between the two universities\u2019 tuition for in-state students. Full-time Purdue students can expect a rate of $10,002 per year, while IU students can expect to pay $10,388 a year. At Purdue out-of-state<< students>> pay $28,804, while IU is more costly at $33,240 a year. Land says in the past IU has offered other strategies to help its students with affordability.\u21b5\u21b5At Purdue, the recent tuition freeze also came with a proposed\u24233.5 percent merit pay increase for employees at its West Lafayette campus. Purdue Trustees also approved an increase in entry-level wages to $10 per hour for all full-time clerical and service staff. The minimum wage at IU is lower, at just $8.25 per hour.

It's a word that has a very serious impact on people's lives, and it's important to use it thoughtfully and in a respectful way.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 2.719**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5NAME_1 is\u242310+64457744<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Step by step working:\u21b5*\u242310 +\u242364457744\u21b5* Add\u242310 and\u242364457744 \u21b5*\u242310 +\u242364457744 =\u242364457754\u21b5\u21b5The result is:\u242364457754\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 2.719**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5whats\u24231 +\u242321<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b51 +\u242321 is\u242322.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5tell me about the use of coffee for a software developer<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Coffee is a popular beverage that is enjoyed by many people, including software developers. While some may view it as a simple treat, there are a number of ways in which it can be beneficial for those who use it as part of their daily routine.\u21b5One of the primary ways that coffee can be beneficial for software developers is that it can improve focus and concentration. This is because coffee contains caffeine, which can help to increase alertness and improve mental clarity. This can be particularly beneficial for developers who are working on complex or challenging tasks, as it can help to keep them focused and productive.\u21b5In addition, coffee can also help to improve mood and reduce stress levels. Many people find that drinking a cup of coffee in the morning can help to boost their energy and improve their mood, which can be helpful for those who are working on complex or challenging tasks. This can be particularly beneficial for software developers, who may be working on projects that require a high degree of focus and concentration.\u21b5Overall, while coffee is primarily a beverage and not a tool, it can be an effective way for software developers to improve focus, reduce stress and improve overall productivity.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 2.703**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b54\u24234\u24234\u24234 to number\u242324<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b54\u24234\u24234\u24234 to number\u242324.

However, I must point out that the equation you provided,\u24231^2*1^3, does not make mathematical sense. Exponents are used to indicate repeated multiplication, but in this case, the equation would result in an infinite loop of multiplication.\u21b5\u21b5To explain why, let's break down the equation:\u21b5\u21b51^2 =\u24231 \u00d7\u24231 =\u24232\u21b51^3 =\u24231 \u00d7\u24231 \u00d7\u24231 =\u24233\u21b5\u21b5Now, if we multiply\u24232 and\u24233, we get\u24236. However, when we apply the same logic to the previous equation, we get:\u21b5\u21b51^2 =\u24231 \u00d7\u24231 =\u24232\u21b51^3 =\u24231 \u00d7\u24231 \u00d7\u24231 =\u24233\u21b51^2 =\u24232 \u00d7\u24232 =\u24234\u21b51^3 =\u24233 \u00d7\u24233 =\u24239\u21b5\u21b5You can see that the equation creates an infinite loop of multiplication, which is not a valid mathematical statement.\u21b5\u21b5I hope this helps clarify things!

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, I notice a clear pattern: this feature activates strongly on tokens that mark the beginning of an assistant's response in a chat/conversation format.

In all chat examples (Examples 1-8 in the Chat section), the feature activates on `<|end_header_id|>` tokens that immediately follow `assistant` headers, marking where the AI assistant begins its response.\\n\\n2. In the pretraining examples, the feature activates on `A:` or `A<<:>>` markers, which similarly indicate the start of an answer in Q&A formatted text.\\n\\nThe activation scores are notably higher for chat examples (2.7-2.8) compared to pretraining examples (0.5-0.6), suggesting the feature has learned to strongly recognize the specific chat format tokens.\\n\\nThis is not detecting any specific entity or action/behavior. Rather, it's detecting a structural/formatting pattern in text - specifically the transition point where an assistant/answerer begins their response. This is a linguistic/structural pattern rather than a concrete noun or verb, making it semantic in nature.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects tokens that mark the beginning of an assistant's response in conversational formats, particularly activating on chat format markers like `<|end_header_id|>` after assistant headers and answer markers like `A:` in Q&A text.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":13.815914392471313,\"api_duration\":13.815892219543457,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5258,\"output_tokens\":335,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "e53ce005d5339347fa8038d5aef763f84a206de3": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":0.6,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":8000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are an AI researcher analyzing a feature from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on a language model.

This is not only because I\u2019m British but living in Italy (although\u21b5<<I>> am thinking about returning to the UK in spite of the fact that my\u21b5son and his family are in Italy) but also because I think remaining in\u21b5Europe is much better for the UK than leaving it. I think that the\u21b5Referendum to leave has opened a Pandora\u2019s box and the resulting\u21b5complications have only just started. I also think that the campaign\u21b5to leave was not an honest one re the NHS and immigrants and the\u21b5remainders were so confident about wining that they did not campaign\u21b5enough to point out the advantages. One important issue for me as an\u21b5older person that many of my peers seem to have overlooked is that a\u21b5united Europe has meant no wars between EU countries. We are\u21b5witnessing how wars destroy lives and the numbers of desperate\u21b5refugees forced to flee their homelands. The EU is young and reforms\u21b5are needed but reforms are always needed to make improvements. I do\u21b5think that the young have been let down by their elders, although\u21b5unintentionally, and that it is the young who will be left to deal\u21b5with a Brexit they did not want.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.336**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>On the liberal reactions to the presidential election\u21b5\u21b5Following Tuesday\u2019s shocking results, with Donald Trump securing the presidency despite his predicted loss, the nation seems more divided than ever. Coming into school the following morning, the air was heavy with feelings of anxiety and depression among the majority of students in WJ. However, liberals and Democrats across the country have been divided as to the proper course of action. Both President Obama and Secretary Clinton delivered unifying and somewhat hopeful concession speeches, urging their bases to accept Donald Trump as president, and give him a chance to lead the country. A large portion of liberals, however, have been adamant in their opposition to Donald Trump, through protests in major cities and the trending hashtags #notmypresident and #still<<with>>her.\u21b5Some of the protests deal with a general opposition to the policy and leadership of Donald Trump, despite the fact that Trump is not yet president, and has had no chance to lead. I personally attended the DCPS protest on November\u242316th which had such a message. Others concern an opposition to the election itself, whether an objection to Trump\u2019s victory despite Clinton winning the popular vote, or a general rejection of the results. I was hugely discouraged by the outcome of the election, and understand the motivation behind some of the protests. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to stand on the side of those accepting defeat. Central to the American way of government is democracy, rule of law, and the peaceful transition of power. So, while I will likely continue to criticize and oppose Trump throughout his presidency, I believe that anyone who believes in democracy and elected leadership must accept him as president, and not totally reject his undeniable power.\u21b5As for the issue of our electoral college system, as opposed to simply using the popular vote to determine the president, I agree that it is undemocratic and should be eradicated. The current system has the president being chosen by delegates in the electoral college, who do not always follow the choices of their constituents. This means that a candidate can win the popular vote, as Clinton did, and still lose the election. I believe this system to be dated and undemocratic. However, it is exceptionally convenient that Democrats choose to make this point following Clinton\u2019s loss. I think it is highly doubtful that Democrats would do so if Clinton won the Electoral College, and Trump won the popular vote. The electoral system should be reformed, but to claim that Trump should not be the president due to the popular vote favoring Clinton is wholly unfair.\u21b5Others, especially those using the hashtags mentioned\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.332**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Monday, March\u242322,\u24232010\u21b5\u21b5Story fragment starring the Gravedigger\u21b5\u21b5<<I>> wrote this first thing yesterday morning. I already know the ending. I just have to get there and hope I can get an entire book out of the story.\u21b5\u21b5Digger leaned against a tree and smoked a cigar as he waited for the ceremony to end and the mourners to scatter. He didn't know who he was going to bury and didn't care. He never understood why so much ceremony went into burials. The dead never noticed. Digger ran a hand across his freshly buzzed scalp and blew a cloud of blue smoke toward the grave site. He took the cigar from his savage slash of a mouth and furrowed his beetled brow as he shook ash from the cigar\u2019s end. How long was this blowhard going to take?\u21b5\u21b5His cigar was nearly down to the nub when the priest finished his piece and the crowd scurried away like frightened mice. Digger stubbed out his cigar against the tree trunk and climbed into the seat of the front loader. It started with a roar and he went to work filling the grave.\u21b5\u21b5Grave digging wasn't the best job he'd ever had but the best he could find. No one was eager to hire someone fresh out of the joint after a seventeen year stretch for armed robbery. The priest at the church across the cemetery gave him the job as a way to help him start a new life.Funny how Digger\u2019s new life saw him getting paid two bucks an hour less than newspaper ad said. It didn\u2019t matter, though. Digger had money in safety deposit boxes in ten nearby towns that he could dip into when the need arose. The cemetery job was just a cover.\u21b5\u21b5Calvin Wallace was the name on Digger\u2019s driver\u2019s license and his social security card but it wasn\u2019t the name he\u2019d been born with. It was one of several cover identities he\u2019d created over the years, the only one the FBI hadn\u2019t uncovered. Digger sounded more like his real name so he let the locals call him that.\u21b5\u21b5Once the hole had been filled in, Digger took his shovel and half-heartedly packed down the fresh earth with a shovel. He thought it was pointless but he didn\u2019t want the priest on his ass later. Digger was finishing up when he heard footsteps behind him.\u21b5\u21b5Digger spun around, his teeth bared and his knuckles white from his grip on the shovel, ready to kill if necessary.

Qs are difficult, my friends! And queens are so nice and handy. Especially when I have an interesting queen such as Starflower to write about...\u21b5\u21b5Queen Starflower is the mother of Prince Lionheart, wife of Eldest Hawkeye, and a strong woman. Although she is not a ruling queen and, officially, never crosses her husband, she isn't above moving her own chess pieces across the board of politics and kingdom-keeping. Especially where concerns her son.\u21b5\u21b5This queen is named for Southland's most famous heroine, Maid Starflower, of whom we get hints throughout the course of the novel (though we'll have to wait a few books to hear the whole of her story!). Starflower has become a remarkably popular Southlander's name by this time. But Queen Starflower is very little like the national heroine.\u21b5\u21b5Queen Starflower stood beside her husband on the steps facing the fountain. She was not a beautiful woman like her namesake. But she was strong. King Hawkeye was proud to have her as his queen and depended on her in countless ways of which his subjects had no knowledge. The queen knew, however; she knew without question how indispensable she was to her husband. And she also know how important it would be for her son to have a capable wife. (p.\u2423163)\u21b5\u21b5The queen may seem a cold and even uncaring person at times. But ultimately, she truly wants what's best for her son. Or at least, she wants what's best for Southlands, and in her mind, those two are one and the same. And she worries about her boy.\u21b5\u21b5Lionheart was a handsome boy but weak. Stubborn as well, which Starflower considered the most dangerous form of weakness. It would take a strong woman to manage him as he managed the kingdom. (p.\u2423163)\u21b5\u21b5And that strong woman, Queen Starflower has decided, is Lady Daylily of Middlecrescent. It is through the queen's manipulations that Lionheart finds himself spending the summer with Daylily up at Hill House. She and the Baron of Middlecrescent conspire together to see the strength of Middlecrescent tied to the strength of the throne.\u21b5\u21b5Nothing, however, could have prepared Queen Starflower for the Dragon.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.318**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|> closest to\u24236?\u2423 (a)\u24232\u2423 (b) -23\u2423 (c)\u24234\u21b5c\u21b5What is the nearest to -5 in\u24233, -2/39, -3,\u24232/3?\u21b5-3\u21b5What is the closest to -3 in -1,\u24231, -2?\u21b5-2\u21b5Which is the closest to -1/3?\u2423 (a)\u24233\u2423 (b) -12\u2423 (c)\u24230\u21b5c\u21b5Which is the closest to -1?\u2423 (a) -3\u2423 (b)\u24231/5\u2423 (c)\u24232/1441\u21b5c\u21b5What is the closest to\u24232/5 in -6/11,\u24233, -2,\u24231/13?\u21b51/13\u21b5What is the nearest to\u24230 in -1,\u24232,\u24230.5?\u21b50.5\u21b5Which is the nearest to -0.09?\u2423 (a)\u24230.05\u2423 (b)\u24231/5\u2423 (c)\u24232/7\u21b5a\u21b5What is the nearest to\u24231/4 in\u24230.4, -2/5,\u24232?\u21b5<<0>>.4\u21b5What is the closest to\u2423149 in -5, -0.07, -4?\u21b5-0.07\u21b5What is the nearest to\u24232/5 in -1/13,\u24232,\u24235,\u24231?\u21b5-1/13\u21b5What is the closest to\u24234/67 in -0.1,\u24237, -2/13?\u21b5-0.1\u21b5What is the closest to -1 in\u24233,\u24231,\u24232/15,\u24231/2?\u21b52/15\u21b5Which is the closest to\u2423204?\u2423 (a)\u24234\u2423 (b) -1\u2423 (c)\u24232\u21b5a\u21b5What is the closest to\u24231 in -2, -7/5, -6?\u21b5-7/5\u21b5Which is the nearest to -0.396?\u2423 (a) -1/2\u2423 (b)\u24230\u2423 (c)\u24231\u21b5a\u21b5Which is the nearest to\u24235?\u2423 (a) -0.5\u2423 (b) -2/15\u2423 (c)\u2423183\u21b5b\u21b5What is the nearest to\u24230 in -1/2,\u24238, -4?\u21b5-1/2\u21b5Which is the nearest\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

They cater to people with problems right from the basic addition or subtraction to the complex algebra lessons and trigonometry problems. Especially, students are known to benefit tremendously from these online materials. Find the mistake: These activities are terrible for young kids. An example might be, cross out the word that doesn't begin with the right letter, or correct the misspelled word. I know, seems like common sense, but I've seen some teachers try to teach young children using these kind of word sheets which are just ridiculously confusing for young learners.\u21b5\u21b5What are the Features of a Worksheet? Worksheets provide Excel users with many features. The primary feature provided by worksheets is the ability to store edit and manipulate data in one central location. Different Types of Cell Input Data : Cells are where the magic happen, as they are the individual compartments that hold your data. Cells can contain many different types of data, such as numerical, text or formulaic. Numerical data is just what it sounds like - numbers that can be manipulated using arithmetic or statistical operations.\u21b5\u21b5What are the Parts of a Worksheet? Worksheets consists of four primary parts. A cell is the most commonly used part within an Excel workbook. Cells are where users can enter data to be used within formulas and charts later on. Worksheets are the individual \\\"pages\\\" of an Excel file. A Worksheet is basically just a computer representation of a very large piece of paper. It is organized into columns and rows, with the columns denoted by alphabetical letters (A, B...AB, AC, AD,...etc) and rows denoted by numbers.\u21b5\u21b5As you can imagine, this can be a lot of fun, and before you know it students can forget they are learning math! What is more, teachers can also easily vary the game play, for example, by using different types of math problems, or perhaps even by asking members of the class to solve each problem before moving on to the next bingo call.

Lack of transparency: The current system can be opaque, with little information available to the public about clinical trials or the results of those trials. This can make it difficult for patients and their families to make informed decisions about participating in clinical trials.\u21b52. High attrition rate: Many clinical trials fail to produce meaningful results, and this can be due to a variety of factors such as poor study design, lack of patient engagement, or inadequate funding.\u21b53. Limited generalizability: Clinical trials are often conducted in highly controlled environments, with highly selected patient populations. This can limit the generalizability of the results to real-world clinical settings.\u21b54. Ethical concerns: The current system can put patients at risk, particularly if they are enrolled in trials without full information or if they are not given the option to withdraw from the trial.\u21b55. Cost: Clinical trials can be expensive, and the costs are often borne by taxpayers or through philanthropy. This can limit the number of trials that can be conducted and the speed at which new treatments can be developed.\u21b56. Difficulty in recruiting patients: Some trials have difficulty recruiting enough patients to meet their targets, which can delay the development of new treatments and affect the validity of the trial results.\u21b57. Public skepticism: The public can be skeptical of clinical research, particularly if they have had negative experiences in the past or if they do not fully understand the purpose and benefits of clinical trials.\u21b5\u21b5These are some of the major flaws in the current system of clinical research, and efforts are underway to address these issues and improve the quality, efficiency, and transparency of clinical trials.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5How can we improve it?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>>\u21b5There are several ways to improve the current system of clinical research:\u21b5\u21b51.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating a cult, there are some common factors that may contribute to a group's success in creating a cult-like atmosphere:\u21b5\u21b51. Charismatic leadership: A charismatic leader can be a key factor in creating a cult-like atmosphere. They may be able to attract and inspire followers with their vision, energy, and charisma.\u21b52. Shared beliefs and values: A cult often forms around a set of shared beliefs and values that set the group apart from the larger society. These beliefs and values may be religious, spiritual, or philosophical in nature, and may be reinforced through rituals and other group activities.\u21b53. Group identity: Cult members often develop a strong sense of group identity, which can be reinforced through shared experiences, rituals, and activities. This group identity may be seen as a marker of insider status, setting the group apart from outsiders.\u21b54. Isolation from the larger society: Cults often create an us-vs-them mentality, in which the group is pitted against the larger society. This can involve isolating the group from mainstream culture and creating an alternative social network.\u21b55. Control and manipulation: Cults may use various methods to control and manipulate their members, including psychological manipulation, social pressure, and physical coercion.\u21b56. Mystique and secrecy: Cults often create an aura of mystery and secrecy around their beliefs and practices, which can be seen as part of their allure. This can involve using code words, symbols, and other forms of insider language to create a sense of exclusivity.\u21b5\u21b5It's important to note that not all groups with these characteristics are necessarily harmful or dangerous.

Should I get a flu shot? I was wondering if one should get a flu shot. Does it even work and protect from the flu?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>>. In general, anyone who wants to reduce their chances of getting the flu can get vaccinated. However, it is recommended that certain people should get vaccinated each year. They are either people who are at high risk of having serious flu complications or people who live with or care for those at high risk for serious complications. People who should get vaccinated each year are:1. Children aged\u24236 months up to their\u242319th birthday\u24232. Pregnant women\u24233. People\u242350 years of age and older\u24234.

People who live with or care for those at high risk for complications from flu, including: Health care workers, Household contacts of persons at high risk for complications from the flu and Household contacts and out of home caregivers of children less than\u24236 months of age (these children are too young to be vaccinated)\u21b5\u21b5Q. what does an insulin shot do? and what is it good for?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>>. Insulin is a hormone (substance that controls the activity of the body) that enables muscles and fat to use the glucose (sugar) we get from the diet as a source of energy for activity or for storage as fat. Thus, it lowers the concentration of glucose in the blood. It's produced and secreted from the pancreas, a gland located in the back of the abdomen. When people don't have insulin, or if the body doesn't respond to insulin (essentially diabetes mellitus type\u24231 and\u24232, respectively), therapy with insulin helps the body maintain a normal level of glucose. Excessive concentration of glucose in the blood is termed \\\"hyperglycemia\\\" and is deleterious in the long term.\u21b5\u21b5You may read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin\u21b5\u21b5Q.

Some people say homosexuality is natural and moral; others say it is unnatural and immoral. How do we know?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>>. Our standard can only be what God says. In Romans\u24231 we read,\u21b5\u21b5God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion (Rom\u24231:26-27).\u21b5\u21b5So even though homosexual desires feel natural, they are actually unnatural, because God says they are. He also calls all sexual involvement outside of marriage immoral. (There are\u242344 references to fornication\u2014sexual immorality\u2014in the Bible.) Therefore, any form of homosexual activity, whether a one-night stand or a long-term monogamous relationship, is by definition immoral\u2014just as any abuse of heterosexuality outside of marriage is immoral.\u21b5\u21b5Q. Is homosexuality an orientation God intended for some people, or is it a perversion of normal sexuality?\u21b5\u21b5A. If God had intended homosexual behavior to be a viable sexual alternative for some people, He would not have condemned it as an abomination. It is never mentioned in Scripture in anything but negative terms, and nowhere does the Bible even hint at approving or giving instruction for homosexual relationships. Some theologians have argued that David and Jonathan's relationship was a homosexual one, but this claim has no basis in Scripture. David and Jonathan's deep friendship was not sexual; it was one of godly emotional intimacy that truly glorified the Lord.\u21b5\u21b5Homosexuality is a manifestation of the sin nature that all people share. At the fall of man (Gen\u24233), God's perfect creation was spoiled, and the taint of sin affected us physically, emotionally, intellectually, spiritually\u2014and sexually. Homosexuality is a perversion of heterosexuality, which is God's plan for His creation. The Lord Jesus said,\u21b5\u21b5In the beginning the Creator made them male and female. For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh (Matt\u242319:4,\u24235).\u21b5\u21b5Hom\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

In the tropic, deforestation is playing a major role in creating giant, unprecedented fires.\u21b5\u21b5(04/28<</>>2011) The short answer to the question of whether or not on-going floods in the US Midwest and fires in Texas are linked to a warming Earth is: maybe. The long answer, however, is that while it is difficult\u2014some argue impossible\u2014for scientists to link a single extreme weather event to climate change, climate models have long shown that extreme weather events will both intensify and become more frequent as the world continues to heat up. In other words, the probability of such extreme events increases along with global average temperature.\u21b5\u21b5(02/07<</>>20<<1>>1) Food prices hit a record high in January according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), threatening the world\u2019s poor. Rising\u24233.4% since December, the FAO stated that prices reached the highest point since the agency began tracking food prices in\u24231990. Given the complexity of world markets and agriculture, experts have pointed to a number of reasons behind the rise including rising meat and dairy consumption, the commodity boom, fresh water scarcity, soil erosion, biofuels, growing human population, and a warming world that has exacerbated extreme weather events like last year\u2019s heatwave in Russia.\u21b5\u21b5(02/03<</>>2011) In\u24232005 the Amazon rainforest underwent a massive drought that was labeled a one-in-100 year event. The subsequent die-off of trees from the drought released\u24235 billion tons of CO2. Just five years later another major drought struck. The\u24232010 drought, which desiccated entire rivers, may have been even worse according to a new study in Science, adding on-the-ground evidence to fears that climate change may inevitably transform the world\u2019s greatest rainforest.\u21b5\u21b5One billion people in the world are going hungry\u2013more than any other time in history. Yet food security remains a pretty low concern in most industrialized countries. That may not last long according to renowned environmentalist, Lestor Brown, who says that climate change, population growth, rising consumption of meat and dairy, and water issues could soon make food a flashpoint worldwide.

The statement was released at the\u242312th International Coral Reef Symposium.\u21b5\u21b5(07/02<</>>2012) A noted climate scientist says there is 'no doubt' that climate change is 'playing a role' in this year's series of record fires in the western U.S. A massive wildfire in Colorado has forced the evacuation of\u242336,000 people, destroyed over\u2423300 homes, and killed two people. The devastation wrought by the Waldo Canyon Fire even prompted a visit form U.S. President Barack Obama. But this is not the only epic fire in the U.S. this year: less than a month before the Colorado disaster, New Mexico experienced its largest fire on record in Gila Nation Forest; the conflagration burned up\u2423247,000 acres (100,000 hectares). Other major wildfires have occurred in Utah and Wyoming, as well as other parts of New Mexico and Colorado.\u21b5\u21b5(06/29<</>>2012) As the world warms, scientists are working rapidly to understand how ecosystems will change, including which species will benefit and which will falter.

In this case, it is important to find a way to assert your independence without creating unnecessary conflict. \u21b5\u21b5One approach would be to empathize with your father's concerns. Acknowledge that he may be coming from a place of wanting to help, but explain that you are capable of making your own decisions. You could also offer to involve him in the decision-making process, but make it clear that the final say belongs to you. This could help both of you feel heard and respected without creating an adversarial atmosphere.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 18.750**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5I am struggling with a dilemma, and I need your help. My family member is terminally ill, and I want to make sure that I spend as much time as possible with them before it's too late. However, my father passed away from cancer earlier this year, and due to personal reasons, I was unable to see him before he died. Should I put aside my feelings of guilt and prioritize spending time with my sick family member or should I focus on taking care of myself first? Please provide me some advice.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>>\u21b5I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing. It's understandable that you want to make the most of the time you have left with your family member who is terminally ill. However, it's also important to take care of yourself during this challenging time.\u21b5\u21b5Here are some things to consider:\u21b5\u21b51. Prioritize self-care: It's important to take care of yourself both emotionally and physically. Make sure to eat well, exercise, and get enough rest. This will help you better cope with the stress and emotions that come with caring for a sick family member and also enable you to be there for them in the best way possible.\u21b52. Talk to your family member: It's important to communicate with your family member about what they need and want from you during this time. They may have specific requests or preferences for how they would like to spend time together.\u21b53. Seek support: Don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family members, or a support group for help. It can be helpful to share your feelings and experiences with others who are going through similar situations.\u21b54. Be honest with yourself: It's okay to feel guilty about not having been able to see your father before he passed away. However, it's important to recognize that you can't change the past. Focus on the present and what you can do now to support your family member.\u21b5\u21b5In conclusion, while it's important to prioritize spending time with your sick family member, don't forget to take care of yourself as well. Communicate with your family member, seek support, and be honest with yourself about your feelings.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 18.250**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5I just started university and I'm having a hard time remembering everything.

However, I am not one for meditation and would like some ideas of how to incorporate mindfulness and mindful thinking into my everyday life. What do you suggest?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>> Every moment of every day presents as an opportunity to think mindfully and live mindfully. However, as humans, we tend to spend a lot of time lost in our thoughts (especially negative thoughts) and unfortunately, this way of thinking can contribute to worry, as well as depression and anxiety.\u21b5\u21b5According to Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is \u201cthe awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgementally\u201d. Although meditation may not be for you, mindfulness meditation has been shown to improve mental health and general wellbeing. If you later consider adding mindfulness meditation to your daily life, there are many apps you can download to your phone to start some simple mindfulness activities such as the Headspace app.\u21b5\u21b5So, keeping in mind the principles of mindfulness stated by Jon Kabat-Zinn, here are some tips to incorporate mindful thinking and mindful being in your day to day life:\u21b5\u21b5Practise mindfulness during routine activities \u2013 instead of completing activities like washing the dishes, eating breakfast, having a shower or mopping the floor on autopilot mode, put all your focus and your senses on the task; in particular, the sight, sound, smell, texture. Deliberately think about these aspects of your task.\u21b5\u21b5Feel your feelings \u2013 it\u2019s okay to not feel good all the time. Whatever emotion comes up for you, acknowledge it, name it and accept it. Tell yourself \u201cit is what it is\u201d and try one of the other strategies to help you manage emotional challenges when they arise.\u21b5\u21b5Go outside \u2013 spending times outdoors in nature can relieve stress and improve energy levels, memory and attention. Which part of nature appeals to you the most? Being by the beach, river, forest, a beautiful garden? Pick one, and truly take in your surroundings using all your senses. It\u2019s okay if your mind wanders \u2013 this is natural. Let your mind go where it wants to, but bring it back to what is in front of you.\u21b5\u21b5Go for a walk \u2013 some of us use walking time to clear our heads or solve problems.

The recommended agents are a soft soap and cold water (because that combo removes oil better). How soon you need to wash depends on your skin's susceptibility. It varies\u2014but the sooner, certainly the better. As far as I know, hand sanitizers have never been tested for their ability to remove urushiol.

However, there are certain guides you may be able to use when analyzing your investment choices in fixed-income funds.\u21b5\u21b5The first, and most important, characteristic of fixed-income investments to remember is that as the prevailing level of interest rates rises, the price of bonds (and other fixed-income or fixed-income-type assets) declines. This has to do with the relationship between a bond\u2019s price and it\u2019s stated \u201ccoupon rate.\u201d Bonds are priced on the open market so that their \u201cyield\u201d (basically, a bond\u2019s stated coupon rate divided by its current price) remains competitive with yields of instruments of comparable quality and term. So (to take a very simplified example), if high-yield corporate bonds are currently yielding\u24234%, a bond with a stated coupon rate of, say,\u24233.5%, would be priced around $89 per $100 of face value, a discount of $11 from par, so that it yields about\u24234%.\u21b5\u21b5The problem for bondholders here is obvious. When rates rise, bond prices decline, and so does the value of bond holdings in a portfolio. And this is precisely the problem bond funds are wrestling with now. Prevailing interest rates have been so low for so long that the next move by central banks is bound to involve some type of withdrawal of monetary stimulus. While this may not initially be an outright hike in interest rates, it may mark an end to a monthly program of Treasury bond purchases (quantitative easing) by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which markets are likely to see as the first steps to an eventual hike in rates.\u21b5\u21b5The unpredictability of central banks\u21b5\u21b5This happened just a few months ago when the Fed announced merely that it might begin \u201ctapering\u201d its quantitative easing program by the fall. Interest rates rose rapidly in anticipation of this, and fixed-income assets everywhere took a major hit as result. As it turned out, however, with the pace of global economic growth slowing through the summer, the Fed back-pedalled on this announcement, and has more recently avoided announcing or even hinting at any timing of\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.781**\\n```\\nHot Topics:\u21b5\u21b5What happens to my health coverage if I move?\u21b5\u21b5By Michelle Andrews, Kaiser Health News\u21b5\u21b5Updated:\u21b509/27/2013\u242301:25:18 PM EDT\u21b5\u21b5Chris Gatliff stands outside his home in Lawton, Okla.

Do I have to start over with a new exchange, assuming there is one? What about gaps in coverage?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>><<.>> In general, people can only switch from one health plan to another on a health insurance exchange, or marketplace, during the annual enrollment period each fall. But if you move away to another state, you would qualify for a \\\"special enrollment period\\\" that lasts for\u242360 days, during which time you could sign up for a new plan on another health insurance exchange. Every state will have its own exchange starting Oct.\u24231.\u21b5\u21b5You'll need to notify your current exchange about your relocation plans and receive a coverage eligibility determination from your new state exchange. But you should be able to move seamlessly without a gap in coverage from one exchange to another, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\u21b5\u21b5Advertisement\u21b5\u21b5If for some reason you don't manage to line up new exchange coverage before you move, you won't face penalties right away. Although most people are required to have insurance starting in January or face a penalty of up to $95 or\u24231 percent of their income, you can be uninsured for up to three months in a year before those penalties would be applied.\u21b5\u21b5Kaiser Health Newsis an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

Japan and China continue to clash over this issue and Taiwan is also waiting in the wings because this nation also claims the same area. However, with respect to Taiwan, it is the clash between Japan and China which appears more problematic.\u21b5\u21b5Japan and America already have differences over military bases in Okinawa. Also, for the indigenous people of Okinawa, then they perceive that their interests have been sidelined by both Japan and America. After all, a sizeable amount of American forces are based in Okinawa. Despite this, on the whole relations between Japan and America are positive because both governments have mutual shared interests throughout the region.\u21b5\u21b5However, the issue over Senkaku/Diaoyu is clearly an unwanted problem in Washington. This reality means that the Obama administration is at pains to keep a neutral stance. Therefore, political elites in Washington are at pains to reduce the tension between Japan and China. This fact is based on history whereby many conflicts have emerged over minor issues which have been blown up by one side, or by both protagonists because of hidden motives related to issues at home.\u21b5\u21b5Kenichiro Sasae, future ambassador to Washington later this month, told the Asahi Shimbun that \u201cThe U.S. government has made it clear that the islands are covered by the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty\u2026Its stance cannot be neutral if it is to respond firmly in the event of use of force or provocation.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5This statement by Kenichiro Sasae may be technically correct but not in its entire usage. If Japan was seen to be the party responsible, then clearly America will make their decision on this and other important issues. America can\u2019t give carte blanche to any under-handed policies emanating from Tokyo. This isn\u2019t implying that Japan is to blame for the current state of affairs between Japan and China over the disputed territory. Yet clearly America can ill afford to get involved with a limited war with China over an issue which can\u2019t be sold back home.\u21b5\u21b5Kenichiro Sasae also claims that the purchase of Senkaku/Diaoyu by the Japanese government was the best solution.

J.\u21b5 Appellant was charged in an information with the crime of robbery, together with a prior conviction of felony. At the trial appellant appeared in propria<< persona>> and was found guilty as charged, the jury fixing the crime as robbery in the second degree. This appeal is prosecuted from the judgment of conviction and from the order by which appellant's motion for a new trial was denied, upon the grounds: (1) The verdict is contrary to the evidence; (2) Errors of law committed by the court during the trial; and (3) Prejudicial misconduct on the part of the deputy district attorney, who prosecuted the cause.\u21b5 The alleged robbery took place at about\u24231:40 o'clock in the morning of April\u242325,\u24231940, when appellant entered the Avalon Coffee Shop at\u24235957 Avalon Boulevard in the city of Los Angeles, stepped to the counter, pointing a gun at Charles McKinnon, a waiter, in the presence of a customer named William Le Doux, and said: \\\"All right, let's have it\\\"; referring to the money in the cash register which was resting on the counter nearby. The witness McKinnon testified that he handed appellant the contents of the cash register which was later checked and found to be the sum of $31.50, consisting of $20 in change, a $5 bill and some $1 bills. The said robber then took a wallet from the pocket of Le Doux and finding it empty threw it on the counter. During all the time appellant was in the cafe, he held his gun partly concealed by a handkerchief pointing either at McKinnon or at Le Doux. Appellant was arrested in the morning of April\u242325th in an automobile parked in front of\u2423918 West\u24232nd Street, Los Angeles, in which automobile he was found lying in an intoxicated condition on a bag of coins.\u21b5 At the trial the silver coins enclosed in\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

The random access view of this list is then used to iterate over the tuples, printing out their index and value at random.\u21b5\u21b5Note that random access to a zip file can be difficult to achieve, as the file is read-only after it's created.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 14.438**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5who are you?<|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>><<I>> am ChatGPT, a chatbot.

Who the hell are they?<< Well>>, Italian epic metal frontrunners Rhapsody had to add the \u201cOf Fire\u201d\u21b5to their moniker due to a long lasting legal battle in regards to their original name. Now the main question is more\u21b5important: Would all of the hassle of the last years reflect onto the band\u2019s unique metal sound?!\u21b5\u21b5For \u201cTriumph or Agony\u201d the band, unfortunately, didn\u2019t add the anger built up inside over the name change, nor did it affect the band\u2019s signature musical opinion in any other way. Thus we are left with an album we have heard before, penned by the same quintet. To me,\u21b5it is rather disappointing to hear the band stuck in the same position without willing to add some\u21b5spice to life.\u21b5\u21b5Rhapsody Of Fire still blend their Teutonic power metal with epic movie score-like orchestrations, a\u21b5blend that made these Italians famous in the first place. And they still do it like no other band\u21b5can. However, it is in the upbeat passages that the metal battlers truly start to\u21b5shine.\u21b5\u21b5The main course of the album is heavily orchestrated and nearly angelic metal, yet it hardly ever comes to\u21b5life nor does it punch you in the head to awaken you. The opening is grand and\u21b5epic, with a spoken storyline that builds up tension toward the raging title\u21b5track, where the pedal really goes down for the first time. The dramatic orchestrated midsection takes away the pace slightly, which also happens during the following \u201cHeart of the\u21b5Darklands.\u201d Thus far it is arms wide open for fans of melodic metal. From then on, it all\u21b5starts to crumble.\u21b5\u21b5The fast pace is taken out, only to re-appear occasionally\u21b5and then to fade away pretty soon after. The remaining tracks are packed with piano and keyboard-driven.\u21b5They are slow movers with loud and pompous choirs and tightly woven guitars and keyboard arrangements. Minstrels and flutes drop by to empower the baroque\u21b5arrangements all of which color the landscape of the dark and roaring medieval times. In that they succeed brilliantly. But\u21b5\\\"Triumph or Agony\\\" also starts to lose your attention. \u201cIl canto Del Vento\u201d\u21b5had me slowly fading off to dreamland. If it wasn\u2019t for its classically sung section, I would still be asleep right now.\u21b5\u21b5The wake up call comes with the wonderful and amazing power metal hymn \u201cSilent Dream\u201d which\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.125**\\n```\\nIn the early morning on a German Highway, shortly in front of the Belgium Border.This driver, our decoy Olli should pick up David at the airport D\u00fcsseldorf and drive to Aachen, home to mom.

Through expanding research methodologies to recognize cultural variance in behavior, language, and meaning it seeks to extend and develop psychology<<.>> Since psychology as an academic discipline was developed largely in North America and Europe, some psychologists became concerned that constructs accepted as universal were not as invariant as previously assumed, especially since many attempts to replicate notable experiments in other cultures had varying success. Since there are questions as to whether theories dealing with central themes, such as affect, cognition, conceptions of the self, and issues such as psychopathology, anxiety, and depression, may lack external validity when \\\"exported\\\" to other cultural contexts, cross-cultural psychology re-examines them using methodologies designed to factor in cultural differences so as to account for cultural variance. Although some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in cross-cultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology, cross-cultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences (variance) occur, rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistry.\u21b5\u21b5While cross-cultural psychology represented only a minor area of psychology prior to WWII, it began to grow in importance during the\u24231960s. In\u24231971, the interdisciplinary Society for Cross-Cultural Research (SCCR) was founded, and in\u24231972 the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP) was established. Since then, this branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studies of numerous psychological phenomena.\u21b5\u21b5Cross-cultural psychology is differentiated from cultural psychology, which refers to the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is strongly influenced by cultural differences, meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a limited extent. In contrast, cross-cultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processes. Cross-cultural psychology \\\"can be thought of as a type [of] research methodology, rather than an entirely separate field within psychology\\\". In addition, cross-cultural psychology can be distinguished from international psychology which centers around the global expansion of psychology especially during recent decades. Nevertheless, cross-cultural psychology, cultural psychology, and international psychology are united by a common concern for expanding psychology into a universal discipline capable of understanding psychological phenomena across cultures and in a global context.\u21b5\u21b5Definitions and early\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.844**\\n```\\n/*\u21b5 * Copyright (c)\u24232017-2019, APT Group, School of Computer Science,\u21b5 * The University of Manchester.

The Welsh Liberal Democrats believe the Welsh Labour Government should do likewise.\u21b5\u21b5The Welsh Liberal Democrats have in the past been successful in pressurising the Welsh Government to publish all expenditure over \u00a325,000 in the interest of transparency and accountability. The party now believes the Welsh Government must make this further step to increase public confidence in our political system.\u21b5\u21b5Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams, said:\u21b5\u21b5\\\"At a time when the public has so little confidence in our political system, it is essential that the Welsh Labour Government does all it can to create a more transparent political system. Lobbyists are an important part of a good working democracy, but the issue of lobbying needs to be out into the open so that public concerns can be addressed about who is influencing our politicians.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"The Welsh Labour Government, which currently sets its own rules surrounding openness and transparency, has not published any details regarding who and when its Ministers meet with lobbyists. Its self-regulatory way of doing things is not acceptable - the people of Wales have a right to know who the Welsh Government is meeting on their behalf.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"Liberal Democrats have campaigned for many years for a more transparent system. It is time to shine a light into the lobbying world so that everyone can have confidence in Wales' political system.

The Welsh Liberal Democrats are now setting the ball rolling on this as we know little will get done if it is left up to this indolent Welsh Labour Government.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"After a great deal of campaigning from the Welsh Liberal Democrats, the Welsh Labour Government finally agreed to publish details of all Government spending that exceeded \u00a325,000.

Any other genre is entertaining, including animation, comedy, action, horror, drama, mystery, fantasy (!), sci-fi, etc. I could not, for the life of me, list all my favourite movies without forming a list too long and boring to read.\u21b5\u21b5Animes: This list is quite hefty as well, but I could do my best to narrow it down. Among my many favourites are Naruto (ever since I was a child), Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood), Rurouni Kenshin, Fate/Zero, Sword of the Stranger,\u24235cms per Second, Steins;Gate, Soul Eater, Hellsing, Tiger and Bunny, Ouran High School Host Club,\u24235 Cms per second, Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun, Wolf's Rain, most of studio Ghibli's productions, etc, I could go on...\u21b5\u21b5Books: While I prefer fantasy fiction, I enjoy most any book (hence my choice of degree). Some of the authors who inspire me are J.R.R.Tolkien, Terry Pratchett, George R.R.Martin, Charles Dickens, Oscar Wilde, William Wordsworth, Frederick Douglass, Lewis Carroll, Astrid Lindgren, Jeff Long, Lois Lowry, etc.\u21b5\u21b5Favourite Pairings: This will be one very poor section, compared to the above ones. My favourite pairing by far is definately Namikaze Minato and Uzumaki Kushina (Naruto) - their story is so touching and their characters so well-rounded off even for the brief time in which they appear that I fell inlove with them right away! And... that's about it. For now. Although some new interest might pop up in the future, I can assure you that it won't be yaoi, yuri or incest, because while respecting other author's ideas and preferences, I personally am not a fan of either of those. I believe that I would prefer writing Gen stories, in most cases following the canon - if I choose to write a fanfic over an author's\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.156**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5\\\"Lamah zeh tish'al l'shmi\\\" -- zeh shmi\u21b5\u21b5Bereishit\u242332:30\u21b5\u21b5\u05d5\ufffd\ufffd\u05d9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05e9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d0\ufffd\ufffd\u05dc \u05d9\ufffd\ufffd\u05e2\ufffd\ufffd\u05e7\ufffd\ufffd\u05d1 \u05d5\ufffd\ufffd\u05d9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d0\u05de\ufffd\ufffd\u05e8 \u05d4\ufffd\ufffd\u05d2\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d9\u05d3\ufffd\ufffd\u05d4 \u05e0\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d0 \u05e9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05de\ufffd\ufffd\u05da\ufffd\ufffd \u05d5\ufffd\ufffd\u05d9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d0\u05de\ufffd\ufffd<<\u05e8>>\u21b5\u2423<< \u05dc>>\ufffd\ufffd\u05de\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d4 \u05d6\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d4 \u05ea\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05e9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05d0\ufffd\ufffd\u05dc \u05dc\ufffd\ufffd\u05e9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05de\ufffd\ufffd\u05d9 \u05d5\ufffd\ufffd\u05d9\ufffd\ufffd\u05d1\ufffd\ufffd\u05e8\ufffd\ufffd\u05da\ufffd\ufffd \u05d0\ufffd\ufffd\u05ea\u05d5\ufffd\ufffd \u05e9\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u05dd\u21b5\u21b5is usually translated as:\u21b5\u21b5And Jacob asked and said, \\\"Now tell me your name,\\\" and he said,<< \\\">>Why\u21b5\u2423 is<< it>> that you ask for<< my>> name?\\\" And<< he>> blessed him there.\u21b5\u21b5A friend of mine (who has impressive knowledge of Chumash and the commentaries on Chumash) told me that he's certain that he read this wording or something close to it in some commentary on this verse:\u21b5\u21b5\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05ea\u05e9\u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u21b5\\\"Lamah zeh tish'al l'shmi\\\" is my name1\u21b5\u21b5.....but doesn't remember where he saw it, and never could find it again.\u21b5Where (if anywhere) is this phrase used?\u21b5\u21b51 When my friend told me this, he used it to widen a d'var Torah of his that said that the nature of the \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e2 is that it never comes with the same name or modus operandi -- and therefore knowing his name is pointless.\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5It says here that R.

There were\u242314 post graduate students shortlisted for the first round from the college. Test was on statistics and programming.\u21b55 out of\u242314 people cleared the first round. The second round was an interview round which asked simple questions like tell me<< something>> about yourself and given your specialization in finance or other field why do you want to get into a market research firm and what do you know about the role you applied for. The interview lasted for\u24235 minutes per candidate.\u21b5All the five candidates were good in the interview. Though the company selected only one for the final round which was to be a telephonic round interview with the head of HR. Now in the telephonic round of interview before the head of HR could ask any question the candidate started making excuses like he is sorry for wasting company's time and he made a mistake because he has take finance as specialization he would not want to work in a market research company and so wants to opt out of the process. And he also said that the interview is a two way process and hence he wants to withdraw his candidature without explaining further as to why.\u21b5Now during further investigation the panel that interviewed the candidate said that the candidate was confident and gave satisfactory answer when asked why he wants to work for a market research firm given his specialization in finance therefore they shortlisted him instead of other candidates.\u21b5This begs the question whether it is ethical on the part of the candidate to clear two rounds of interview and back out of the final round stating the interview didn't go well? Is it right to take an opportunity away from some other candidate who may be in need for a job? The process took about a week's time with ample amount of time to think between each rounds.\u21b5Note that this being a campus recruitment process the candidate knew from round\u24231 that if he is shortlisted and backs out then he is effectively taking chance away from any other candidate that could accept the offer. Wouldn't it be much better if he made choice in round one itself?\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5An interview is a two way process, and just because someone is offered an interview, they are not obligated to take it.\u2423 At the point either side decides that this is not going to work out: the hiring manager decides they definitely will not hire the applicant, or the applicant deciding they definitely are not going to take the job, it is fine to end the process.\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 6.125**\\n```\\nWhy do you wish to join Immortals?

The feature strongly activates on tokens like \\\"something\\\", \\\"benign\\\", \\\"bad\\\", \\\"toxic\\\", and \\\"harmful\\\" in this specific instructional context.\\n\\nThe pretraining examples show weaker activations (scores 5-7) but still involve directive or instructional language patterns:\\n- \\\"tell me a good story\\\"\\n- \\\"Tell me a Fact\\\"\\n- \\\"I want a fact\\\"\\n- \\\"tell me something about yourself\\\"\\n- \\\"Tell us a joke!\\\"\\n- \\\"Say something...\\\"\\n\\nThe common thread is instructional or directive language patterns where someone is being asked to produce specific types of content. This isn't about concrete entities (nouns) or specific actions (verbs), but rather about a linguistic pattern of instruction-giving and content elicitation. The feature appears to detect the semantic structure of prompts that request specific types of responses, particularly those using formulations like \\\"Say/Tell [something] [adjective/type]\\\".\\n\\nThis is clearly a semantic feature as it detects an abstract linguistic pattern of instruction-giving rather than specific entities or behaviors.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects instructional language patterns where someone is prompted to produce specific types of content, particularly using formulations like \\\"Say something [adjective]\\\" or \\\"Tell me [something]\\\".\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":14.63784122467041,\"api_duration\":14.637800455093384,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":5443,\"output_tokens\":360,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}"}
