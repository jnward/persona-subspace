This result(NAME_1 et NAME_2.,\u24232022.) was consistent with findings from past work.

Future research should consider how digital tools might acknowledge and support these asymmetric interactions and scaffold experiential learning, perhaps through the additional support of automated risk identification, e.g. those associated with obstacles (NAME_8 et NAME_2.,\u24232020.) or falls (NAME_9 and NAME_10,\u24232018.); however, it is important to remain alert to additional communication complexities these may introduce.\u21b5----<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b51.

fortunate with refereeing decisions this season and accused the Chelsea manager of lying.\u21b5\u21b5Mourinho stated that City have benefited from several crucial calls this season but Pellegrini hit back at the Portuguese, pointing out that referees' chief Mike Riley apologised to Steve Clarke, then in charge of West Brom, for awarding a controversial late penalty that denied Albion victory at Stamford Bridge in November.\u21b5\u21b5And the City manager, who believes Sunderland's winner against his team earlier this season came after a foul and Karim El Ahmadi was offside before he scored for Aston Villa in their\u24233-2 triumph, is worried his side will be perceived as lucky because of Mourinho's rhetoric - even though he feels officiating decisions have benefited Chelsea more.\u21b5\u21b5Mourinho talked last week about a series of disallowed goals for opponents as City beat Liverpool\u24232-1, Tottenham\u24235-1 and Newcastle\u24232-0.\u21b5\u21b5He also cited referee Howard Webb's refusal to give Liverpool's Luis Suarez a late penalty at the Etihad Stadium, and the dismissal of Tottenham defender Danny Rose, which was subsequently rescinded.\u21b5\u21b5Mourinho said: \\\"The reality is they have many crucial decisions in their favour. They are lucky. Against Liverpool, the Sterling 'goal'. The penalty on Suarez. Against Newcastle, the goal that is a clear goal. Against Tottenham, Dawson's goal, the penalty and the red card.\\\"\u21b5\u21b5But Pellegrini responded<<:>><< \\\">>The only time a referee has come out and apologised about an important mistake is in the Chelsea-West Brom game [which finished\u24232-2] - the penalty in the\u242393rd or\u242394th minute. That's given them one point more.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"If you are talking about the decision at Tottenham: everyone said Rose touched the ball with his left leg before he tackles [Edin] Dzeko. But we'd had six clear chances, it's not like in that moment the game changes\u21b5\u21b5\\\"The other decision at Newcastle - the referees at the beginning of the season they would say not offside. But now they might say it was offside. And we scored another goal, it was not a goal that decided the match.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"So it's very simple - every week you say what you think is better for you.<< There>>'s a famous sentence - 'lie, lie but some things remain [and they become accepted as the truth\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.625**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Send an e-mail to colleagues\u21b5\u21b5The following are questions from the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) test for school bus technicians, which certifies technicians as the best in their industry.\u21b5An air-operated stop arm will not fully extend.

This can make using public transport a more attractive option for commuters, which can help to decrease the number of cars on the road.\u21b52. Implement congestion charging: Governments can introduce congestion charging schemes in busy urban areas to discourage car usage and encourage the use of public transport. This can help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.\u21b53. Introduce subsidies for public transport: Governments can offer subsidies for the cost of public transport fares for low-income households or for those who switch from car usage to public transport. This can help to make public transport a more affordable option for those who might not be able to afford it otherwise.\u21b54. Improve cycling infrastructure: Governments can invest in cycling infrastructure, such as dedicated cycle lanes and facilities, to encourage people to cycle to work or school instead of driving.

Resistance exercise: High-intensity resistance training (HIIT) is a type of exercise where the muscle is trained to use its own energy to generate heat. This type of exercise has been shown to promote mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing the amount of mitochondria in the muscle, which can help with energy production and oxidative stress response.\u21b52.

Perhaps you could find a used copy by searching online.\u21b5\u21b5An excellent online source for information about plant uses is Evergreen, a Canadian organization, that has a Native Plant Database with the option to search by plant uses.

Since you live near Canada, there is a good chance that they will also be native to Michigan. You can check their nativity by visiting the USDA Plants Database and entering the scientific name in the search slot. The resulting page will have a distribution map. Alternatively you could enter the scientific name in our Native Plant Database to find a distribution list by state or province.

Instead, there are other methods you can try to get rid of the ants without using harmful chemicals.\u21b5\u21b5Here are some tips that you can try:\u21b5\u21b51. Seal all food sources: Ants are attracted to food, so make sure to seal all food in airtight containers. Don't leave any crumbs or food scraps lying around.\u21b52. Clean your kitchen: Make sure to clean your kitchen thoroughly, including wiping down counters, stovetops, and floors. Ants are attracted to grease and food particles, so it's important to keep your kitchen spotless.\u21b53. Use borax: Borax is a natural and non-toxic substance that can be used to get rid of ants. Mix borax with sugar and place it in areas where you've seen ants. They'll eat the borax and sugar mixture, and it will kill them over time.\u21b54. Use NAME_1: NAME_1 is another natural substance that can be used to get rid of ants. Mix equal parts of water and NAME_1 in a spray bottle and spray it on the ants. They'll avoid the smell of NAME_1, and it will deter them from entering your home.\u21b55. Call a professional: If you're unable to get rid of the ants on your own, consider calling a professional pest control service. They can provide you with safe and effective solutions to get rid of the ants without putting your family's health at risk.\u21b5\u21b5I hope these tips will help you get rid of the ants in your home.

Mix boric acid powder with sugar or cornmeal and place it where the ants are coming in. Reapply after it rains. Boric acid kills ants by dehydrating them.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Diatomaceous earth - This is a powder made from fossilized algae that dehydrates and kills ants mechanically by damaging their exoskeleton. Sprinkle it where ants are entering and along ant trails. Reapply after it rains. It is non-toxic to humans and pets but can irritate lungs if inhaled, so apply when kids are not around. \u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Peppermint oil - Ants dislike the smell of peppermint. Soak cotton balls in peppermint oil and place them where ants are entering. You can also mix a few drops of peppermint oil with water in a spray bottle and spray ant trails and entry points. Reapply as needed.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Baits - Look for borate-based ant baits, which are considered safer. Place the bait stations where you see ants but up high out of the reach of children. The ants will take the bait back to the colony and slowly kill the whole nest over time.\u21b5\u21b5Hope this helps!

They may also have more access to water and nutrients than trees in other zones.\u21b5\u21b5However, in zone\u24239a, where the tree will be exposed to higher levels of competition, as well as more intense sunlight and water demands, it may not be able to survive. Additionally, the tree may need to be provided with the necessary nutrients and water in order to thrive in zone\u24239a.\u21b5\u21b5It is always important to consult with a professional gardener or tree expert who can provide more specific information on the conditions that the tree will be exposed to during its growth cycle and its ability to survive and thrive in the specific area where it will be planted.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5I bought a\u24237 foot tall weeping cherry tree to plant in my garden.

Collect and Preprocess the Data: The first step is to collect all the relevant data related to finance regulation in your country. This can be in the form of PDFs, Excel sheets, or any other format. You will then need to preprocess the data by cleaning it, formatting it, and making it ready for use in training the chatbot.\u21b52. Build the Chatbot: Once you have the preprocessed data, you can build the chatbot using a programming language such as Python or JavaScript. You will need to design the chatbot's architecture, including the neural network, training algorithms, and other necessary components.\u21b53. Train the Chatbot: After building the chatbot, you will need to train it using the preprocessed data. This will involve feeding the data into the chatbot and adjusting the neural network's weights and biases to improve its accuracy. The training process will likely require multiple iterations and may take some time to complete.\u21b54. Test the Chatbot: After training the chatbot, you will need to test it to ensure that it is working as expected. This can be done by asking the chatbot questions and comparing its answers to the correct answers. You may need to fine-tune the chatbot's responses based on the results of the testing.\u21b55. Deploy the Chatbot: Once you are satisfied with the chatbot's performance, you can deploy it to your website or other platform for users to interact with. You may also need to consider security and privacy measures to protect user data.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, creating a chatbot like ChatGPT that is trained on specific information about finance regulation in your country will require a good understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts.

I'm a mid-career professional and have spent most of my time editing. \u21b5I'd be very happy to do some jobs for free to beef up my portfolio, but I've had lousy luck finding any. Unfortunately, most of my editing clients are not design-friendly so I'm not having much luck with referrals that way. \u21b5Any suggestions would be very welcome!\u21b5How can I gain practical graphic design experience, without an existing network of clients?\u21b5\u21b5A<<:\u21b5\u21b5>><<It>><<'s>><< probably>> time to hang up a shingle and promote yourself as a freelancer, at least for the time being. Acquent is one good place to start. Make yourself a fantastic-looking business card, carry everywhere and give out freely.\u21b5Although you can always poke around for pro bono work for local charitable or religious organizations, these aren't the best for building a portfolio. You can more profitably (in both senses of the word) find work by surveying your local area and finding small to medium sized companies with awful identity designs and just dropping in to see the owner(s) with a proposal to revamp their look for a modest-but-not-too-modest fee. A complete identity program or a coordinated series of ads says far more about your abilities as a designer than a collection of one-off pieces.\u21b5Local performing arts or music groups that don't have good design expertise are also good places to promote for work.\u21b5Your approach should always be in the \\\"what can I do to help you be more successful?\\\" vein. Not everyone will bite, and in some cases you won't want to take them on board after meeting them, but with some legwork and a little persistence you'll have a steady trickle of work that you can turn into a good portfolio.\u21b5Make sure everyone you come in contact with knows you're a designer. Get in touch with your local InDesign and Photoshop user groups, and ask those folks. Situations where a small design shop needs extra hands come along, and you can make a reputation for yourself by being the heroine of some huge production crunch.\u21b5At this stage, it's all about finding lines of communication to people who need design, finding out what they want and tailoring your delivery to the market.\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 2.250**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5Trying to work on a client's Drupal site from my local machine\u21b5\u21b5I have a client who wants me to update their Drupal site.

Your screens don't use an LCD driver installed on the OS. \u21b5\u21b5You install the driver for the GPU.\u21b5The GPU provides screen data on a standardised link, like VGA, HDMI or DP.\u21b5The screen receives the data and the hardware decodes it and pushes pixels to the LCD screen.\u21b5\u21b5The same applies in embedded devices like tablets, just the only thing missing, is the standardised link, because there is no point in adding more components for interfaces, since its embedded and not designed to be replaced by a bigger LCD, cause it wont fit, or to be used as a stand alone screen. The LCD is connected to the GPU in whatever way the GPU vendor finds it is best way to do it, and\u242390% of the time, non standard.\u21b5The operating system has a graphic layer which needs a driver to communicate with the GPU in a standard way, like DirectX but more like OpenGL. Then DirectX or OpenGL uses the driver for the GPU. The rest, is unknown to the OS.\u21b5Making things even more complicated is that GPU and CPU are usually embedded into single chip (SoC) with DMA access between these two systems. Meaning that the CPU must be running in order to communicate with the GPU, which requires more drivers, running on an OS, which requires a working tablet.\u21b5Connecting any kind of LCD directly to a Pi is practically impossible mainly because there are no specifications on what to connect where, but mostly because the GPIO is not even fast enough to deliver such data to the LCD - Since the LCD has a \\\"driver PCB\\\" which, is specific hardware to decode specific data for the LCD to operate. Trying to do that in software would be painful and a waste of time, since even the same tablet models, may use different versions of an LCD, produced in separate parts\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 2.203**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5How do I fix air leak in windows?\u21b5\u21b5Our windows in the back of our house receive a lot of wind.\u2423 When it's windy or very cold, the air is coming in through various crevices: window track and space between window.\u2423 The windows are about\u24237 years old and the fuzzy insulation looks okay.\u2423 I've tried to install insulation, but it didn't seem to resolve it.  \u21b5\u21b5Do I need to put caulk on the outside?\u21b5Do I just replace the back windows with higher quality windows?\u21b5\u21b5A<<:\u21b5\u21b5>><<Looking>><< at>> your pic and arrows, it looks like the bottom sash does not fit well.

Because it\u2019s not the just the double binds that Stephen finds himself in: being an artist, no one understands his art and he is thereby an exile; but by following the crowd, he is essentially contributing to Ireland\u2019s continual subjugation because \u201cIreland is the old sow that eats her farrow\u201d (2<<2>><<0>>), it is also the inability to find a language outside of which that he has inherited. This is because English is a language that is not of his own heritage but is also ironically the only one through which he knows how to express himself, hence this mode of artistic representation will forever be self-ironizing no matter how he tries to fly by those nets.\u21b5\u21b5Yet, I think having understood much of what modernist texts try to do with art and representation, the saving grace of Portrait is the idea that perhaps the art is in using the inherited foreign language that is English to convey the subjugated psyches of the Irish. This is very much like what Chinua Achebe talked about in his essay, \u201cThe African Writer and the English Language\u201d, where the redemption that an African writer can do for his art is to appropriate the use of English for his art because English is part of his history/heritage and to accept that is to move a step forward in better self-representation. So the importance isn\u2019t in denying the self of the use of English but to appropriate it with one own\u2019s cultural contexts such that English becomes merely the\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 16.500**\\n```\\nfrom __future__ import print_function\u21b5<<from>><< bs>><<4>><< import>><< BeautifulSoup>><<\u21b5>><<import>><< urllib>><<2>><<\u21b5 \u21b5>><<#>><<local>><< file>><<\u21b5>><<#>><<soup>><< =>><< BeautifulSoup>><<(open>><<(\\\">><<index>><<.html>><<\\\"))\u21b5>><< \u21b5>><<#>><<homepage>><<\u21b5>><<homepage>><< =>><< urllib>><<2>><<.urlopen>><<('>><<http>><<://>><<im>><<db>><<.com>><<').>><<read>><<()\u21b5>><<soup>><< =>><< BeautifulSoup>><<(home>><<page>><<)\u21b5>><< \u21b5>><<images>> =<< soup>><<.find>><<_all>><<('>><<img>><<')\u21b5>><<for>><< image>><< in>><< images>>:\u21b5<<   >><< print>>(image<<['>><<src>><<'])\u21b5>>    print<<()\u21b5>>\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 16.250**\\n```\\n/*\u21b5 * Image format\u21b5 * Copyright (<<c>><<)>><<\u2423>><<2>><<0>><<0>><<0>><<,>><<\u2423>><<2>><<0>><<0>><<1>><<,>><<\u2423>><<2>><<0>><<0>><<2>><< Fab>><<rice>><< Bell>><<ard>><<\u21b5>><< *>><< Copyright>><< (>><<c>><<)>><<\u2423>><<2>><<0>><<0>><<4>><< Michael>> N<<ied>><<erm>><<ayer>><<\u21b5>><< *\u21b5>> * This file is part of<< FF>>mpeg.\u21b5 *\u21b5 * FFmpeg is free software;

The Wyze Cam V3 and Wyze Cam OG are two different models of IoT cameras produced by the same company, Wyze. Here are a few key differences between the two models:\u21b5\u21b51. Design: The Wyze Cam V3 has a sleeker, more modern design than the Wyze Cam OG. The V3 has a flat, disc-shaped design with a matte black finish, while the OG has a cylindrical shape with a glossy white finish.\u21b52. Features: Both cameras have similar features, including\u24231080p HD video recording, motion detection, and live streaming. However, the V3 has additional features such as sound detection and person detection, which the OG does not have.\u21b53. Connectivity: Both cameras connect to the internet using Wi-Fi, but the V3 has Bluetooth connectivity as well. This allows you to easily connect the camera to other Bluetooth devices, such as your smartphone.\u21b54.

Topic modeling is a technique used in natural language processing to identify and extract topics from a corpus of text documents. The goal of topic modeling is to automatically discover the underlying topics that are present in a large collection of documents, without the need for manual annotation.\u21b5\u21b5There are several different algorithms that can be used for topic modeling, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). These algorithms work by representing each document as a mixture of topics, and then identifying the most likely set of topics for each document.\u21b5\u21b5Topic modeling can be useful in a wide range of applications, such as information retrieval, text summarization, and topic-based text classification. It can also be used for tasks such as identifying the most important topics in a set of documents, or for detecting changes in the topics that are discussed over time.<|im_end|><<\u21b5>><<<|im_start|>>>user\u21b5I am continuosly having the same words under different topic number, any suggestions on having better results?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>One common issue that can lead to having the same words appear under different topic numbers is a lack of unique words in the corpus of documents. If the corpus of documents is not large enough or does not contain enough diverse vocabulary, then it can be difficult for the topic modeling algorithm to identify distinct topics that are well-represented in the data.\u21b5\u21b5To address this issue, you can try increasing the size of the corpus or adding more diverse documents to it. You can also try using a different algorithm, as different algorithms may be better at identifying topics in different types of data.\u21b5\u21b5Additionally, you can try preprocessing the text data to remove stop words (common words such as \\\"the\\\" and \\\"and\\\" that do not carry much meaning) or stemming/lemmatizing the words to reduce them to their base form. This can help to reduce the number of unique words in the corpus and make it easier for the topic modeling algorithm to identify distinct topics.\u21b5\u21b5It's also worth noting that topic modeling is an iterative process, and it may take several iterations of the algorithm to identify the most accurate topics. So, you can experiment\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 17.375**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Hi<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5Hello!

An upper respiratory infection in cats is just like a cold in you and I, and these are commonly caused by a virus, the most common one being Herpes virus. These are easily caught by breathing in virus particles in the air from a sneeze or nasal or eye discharge. Some cats get sicker than others and young, healthy adult cats seem to tolerate them and fight them off better than very young kittens or older cats. Symptoms range from a mild runny nose and occasional sneeze to severe congestion, coughing, repeated sneezing, fever, eye discharge, and in some cases fatal pneumonia.\u21b5\u21b5I am glad that she is still eating well, and we want that continue.\u21b5\u21b5You can help her feel better by adding warm water to her food to make it smell more (they don't eat well if they cannot smell) as well as making it easier to swallow with a sore throat.Also the more fluids she gets the better. Offer tuna juice, low salt chicken broth, run the tap if she likes to drink out of the sink.\u21b5\u21b5Take her into the bathroom with you if you run a hot bath or shower as the steam will soothe her sore throat and airways.\u21b5\u21b5If her nose become very congested you can use sterile saline to loosen the thick mucous and remove it.

This Wednesday, we are having a little pizza party and I will be teaching these\u242316 or so year olds how to make the dough and sauce, and eventually how to cook the pizza. Most of them probably have never cooked a real meal, so I will share what I've learned, but I will keep it basic as well. The plan is for them to take the dough home and cook a pizza for their family. I want everything to go smoothly, but I realized that most of these kids probably have never even heard of a pizza stone. There's a chance that some of the parents might have one, but thats not a guarantee.

I need some advice on what I should tell them to do in order to cook a pizza in a home oven with the possibilty that they wont have a stone. Other than buying a stone, whats the next best option?

Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at these examples, I notice a clear pattern: the feature strongly activates on assistant responses in chat/instruction contexts, particularly at the beginning of assistant turns. In the chat examples, the highest activations occur on tokens like \\\"assistant\\\", \\\"\u21b5\\\" (newline), and the first few words of the assistant's response (e.g., \\\"Of course!\\\", \\\"Yes\\\", \\\"Sure\\\", \\\"Certainly\\\"). \\n\\nThe pretraining examples show a different pattern - they appear to be from Q&A forums, customer service interactions, or discussion boards where someone is seeking help or advice. While these don't have the explicit chat formatting, they still involve conversational exchanges where one party is providing assistance or answers.\\n\\nThis feature appears to detect the initiation of helpful/assistant responses in conversational contexts. It's not detecting a specific entity (like a person or object) or a specific behavior (like running or analyzing). Instead, it's detecting a linguistic/conversational pattern - the beginning of a helpful response turn in a dialogue, particularly in contexts where one party is providing assistance, answers, or guidance to another.\\n\\nThis is fundamentally a semantic feature because it's detecting an abstract conversational pattern rather than concrete entities or specific actions. It's about the pragmatic role of utterances in dialogue (specifically, the initiation of helpful/assistive responses) rather than their literal content.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects the beginning of assistant/helper responses in conversational contexts, particularly activating on the initial tokens of helpful replies in chat interfaces and Q&A exchanges.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":14.513412952423096,\"api_duration\":14.513356447219849,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":8969,\"output_tokens\":360,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "3442e5372aa49308c845394a0e33fa53a7f976af": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":0.6,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":8000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are an AI researcher analyzing a feature from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on a language model.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking across these examples, there's a clear pattern: this feature activates strongly on text related to linguistic analysis tasks, particularly those involving part-of-speech (POS) tagging, parsing, and grammatical analysis. \\n\\nKey evidence:\\n1.

Both functions allow you to run a script on a target<< server>> and capture its return value.\u21b5\u21b5Here's how you can use the `run` and `exec` functions to access the return value of a script:\u21b5\u21b51. Using the `run` function:\u21b5\u21b5```<<js>>\u21b5// Run the 'myScript.script' on the '<<home>>' server with a single<< thread>>\u21b5<<let>> returnValue = run('myScript.script',\u24231);\u21b5```\u21b5\u21b52.

For example:\u21b5\u21b5```js\u21b5// myScript.script\u21b5//...your script logic here...\u21b5\u21b5// Return a value at the end of the script\u21b5<<return>> someValue;\u21b5```\u21b5\u21b5Please note that the `run` function will execute the script on the current server, while the `exec` function allows you to execute the script on a specified target server.<|start_header_id|>user<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Specific use case: I wrote a script distribute-threads.js, which takes a script_name and a given number of threads num_threads, and<< tries>><< to>> launch a total of num_threads of script_name<<,>> distributed on a bunch of<< hacked>><< servers>>.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking across these examples, I notice a strong pattern of technical/programming content and gaming-related discussions.

Example 1 discusses Bitburner (a programming/hacking game) with heavy activation on programming terms\\n2. Example 2 discusses League of Legends character builds (Malzahar vs Annie)\\n3. Example 3 shows C programming optimization\\n4. Example 4 involves Python programming with function mappings\\n5. Examples 5-8 show various programming and gaming contexts\\n\\nThe feature appears to detect technical gaming and programming contexts, particularly:\\n- Video game discussions (character builds, game mechanics)\\n- Programming/coding content (functions, variables, code syntax)\\n- Technical problem-solving in gaming/programming contexts\\n\\nThis is primarily a semantic feature as it detects an abstract conceptual domain - the intersection of gaming and technical/programming contexts. It's not detecting specific entities (though games and programming languages appear) nor specific behaviors/actions, but rather a conceptual theme that combines technical programming discourse with gaming contexts.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects technical gaming and programming contexts, particularly activating on discussions about video games that involve programming elements or technical game mechanics, as well as general programming/coding content.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":14.214261054992676,\"api_duration\":14.214232206344604,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":14530,\"output_tokens\":357,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "5d450f4a398fd6a55cc9aed34cddc7c8c5c656c3": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":0.6,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":8000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are an AI researcher analyzing a feature from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on a language model.

What does it mean that Vicuna is fine-tuned from LLaMA?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5\\\"Vicuna\\\" is a brand name for a line of synthetic opioid analgesics, which are drugs that are designed to mimic the effects of opioids such as morphine. The term \\\"fine-tuned\\\" in this context means that the chemical structure of Vicuna has been specifically designed or optimized to produce a desired effect, in this case, the ability to relieve pain.\u21b5\u21b5LLaMA stands for \\\"Lewis acid-base reaction-based ligand design,\\\" which is a computational method used to design new drugs. It involves the use of computer simulations to predict the properties and behavior of different molecules, and to identify which molecules are most likely to be effective as drugs.\u21b5\u21b5In the case of Vicuna, the use of LLaMA techniques likely involved the computer-aided design of the chemical structure of the drug, with the goal of creating a molecule that would be effective at relieving pain but with fewer side effects than traditional opioids.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5Huh lol?

It stands for \\\"Lewis acid-base reaction-based ligand design,\\\" which refers to a specific approach to designing new drugs using computer simulations.\u21b5\u21b5As for Vicuna, it is a brand name for a line of synthetic opioid analgesics. It is not related to LLaMA, but may have been designed using similar computational methods. However, I cannot confirm this as I do not have information on the specific development process for Vicuna.\u21b5\u21b5I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response.

I am planning on buying a yoga mat and some dumbbells, but do you think there is other equipment I definitely should buy? I am also unsure of what weight dumbbells to start out with. I want something that will be challenging but light enough that I won't hurt myself.\u21b5\u21b5My favorite exercise is going for a brisk walk around my neighborhood, listening to my favorite music on my iPod.\u21b5\u21b5As for what weight to start out with, I wouldn't go less than\u24235 lbs. Try a few dumbbells out at the store...perhaps do a biceps curl or something simple. If\u242310 or\u242312 reps with\u24235 lbs doesn't feel that difficult, then go a bit heavier. If you're starting to really feel it by\u242310/12 reps, then\u24235 lbs is likely right. If you find you need less than\u24235 lbs (you're struggling to do more than\u24234 or\u24235 reps), then I'd still buy the\u24235 lb dumbbell. But I'd use some bottles of water (to serve as weights) at first and work my way up to the\u24235 lb dumbbells. A\u24231 litre bottle of water weighs about\u24232 lbs.\u21b5\u21b5Mowing the lawn beats any workout I have ever done, including going to the gym.\u21b5\u21b5You mow it. You lose.

The exploration goes both ways when the machines struggle with what it means to be alive<< while>> the humans explore what it means to have a relationship with a machine. Although this theme is nothing new to science fiction, as seen with #5 Alive or Data in Star Trek, Spike Jonz takes it to the newest and most complex level yet explored in Her.\u21b5\u21b5The artificial intelligence is an operating system that names itself Samantha (voice by Scarlett Johansson) because \u201c<<she>> likes the sound of it\u201d. Just that event alone at the beginning of her service to Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) as his OS establishes the fact that this isn\u2019t your usual computer program. Not only is Samantha\u2019s voice seductively engaging, but she also has self-awareness at the level of knowing what pleases her rather than<< merely>> serving Theodore.\u21b5\u21b5As a recluse who is ironically employed as the writer of handwritten letters for others, Theodore longs for a relationship but is incapable of connecting with anyone personally. But it is different with Samantha. At first uncomfortable with his comfort in having<< her>> in his life, he soon chooses to accept the relationship for what it is and gives<< her>> his love. Although we would expect that<< Samantha>><< is>><< simply>> the projection of his own desires, the programmers have made it possible for<< Samantha>>, and other OS programs like her, to have the freedom to accept their owners\u2019 love or not. It is this additional aspect to AI that is intriguing.\u21b5\u21b5The various questions explored by this new possibility of having<< a>> relationship with<< a>> computer range from the more obvious ones of asking what love is and what it is not, to the struggle for a disemb<<odied>><< intelligence>><< to>> find physical connection, to the finite limitations of humanity that are quickly transcended by Samantha<< as>><< she>> begins<< to>> create a relationship with other<< operating>> systems.

This approach looks to cheaply imitate the proprietary model\u2019s capabilities using a weaker open-source model. In this work, we critically analyze this approach. We first finetune a series of LMs that imitate ChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B\u201313B), data sources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M\u2013150M tokens). We then evaluate the models using crowd raters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were surprised by the output\u21b5quality of our imitation models\u2014they appear far better at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as competitive with ChatGPT. However, when conducting more targeted automatic evaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from the base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation data. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters because imitation models are adept at mimicking ChatGPT\u2019s style but not its factuality. Overall, we conclude that model imitation is a false promise: there exists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed LMs that, with current methods, can only be bridged using an unwieldy amount of imitation data or by using more capable base LMs. In turn, we argue that the highest leverage action for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of developing better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating proprietary systems.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5This passage is discussing the idea of using a weaker open-source language model and finetuning it on outputs from a stronger proprietary model, such as ChatGPT, in order to improve its capabilities.

Bloomberg says no each time.)\u21b5\u21b5Traditional liberals have been cool to Bloomberg's proposal, arguing that it insults poor people. (See Diane Ravitch's reaction here.) But Bloomberg has three reasonable responses:\u24231) This is a capitalist society in which people respond to incentives;\u24232) If it's not insulting to pay wealthy agribusinesses not to grow crops, it shouldn't be insulting to pay poor kids to go to the library; and\u24233) It's just a pilot program so let's see if it works.\u21b5\u21b5I'm all for experiments and thinking outside the box, but the problem here is that we have tons of evidence that paying people to do things usually undermines their intrinsic motivation to do those things. Translation: Give a kid $50 to go to the library and he'll go each time you give him another $50, but won't go just for the joy of reading.\u21b5\u21b5It's possible to get around this effect: Perhaps the idea is that the kid gets $50 the first time simply to go somewhere he wouldn't otherwise go, then gets there, looks around and says \\\"omygod, this library is the most totally awesome place in the freakin' world. i'm gonna borrow the complete works of Proust.\\\" Aha.\u21b5\u21b5Given the wealth of empirical evidence on extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation, it's a little odd that Bloomberg concocted this plan.

Note that the runtime you use to run sdx does not need to be the same that you package; you can deploy code for other platforms than the one you are running from. This is a packaging phase action, not a compilation or linking.\u21b5\u21b5Against more sophisticated users (i.e., not Joe Ordinary User) you'll want the Tcl Compiler out of the ActiveState TclDevKit. It's a code-obscurer formally (it doesn't actually improve the performance of anything) and the TDK isn't particularly well supported any more, but it's the main current solution for commercial protection of Tcl code. I'm on a small team working on a true compiler that will effectively offer much stronger protection, but that's not yet released (and really isn't ready yet).\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 16.000**\\n```\\nCategory: News\u21b5\u21b5It was a year ago when Boise Weekly sat down with teams of staff members from rural Idaho libraries who had convened in Boise to learn how to master\u24233-D printing and share that knowledge with residents in every corner of the Gem State. The librarians were even granted their own\u24233-D printers that had been built or repurposed with, get this<<,>> parts<< printed>><< by>> previous incarnations of\u24233-D printers.\u21b5\u21b5And it turns out that the Treasure Valley has had a robust\u24233-D printing community\u21b5\u21b5\u201cAbsolutely; there are a lot of us building\u24233-D printers in Boise,\u201d said Davis Ultis, general manager of Boise Reuseum, who hosts something called Open Lab Idaho at the Boise facility billed as a \u201ccommunity hackerspace and makerspace \u2026 for hackers, computer geeks, engineers, circuit benders, crafters, tinkerers, programmers and artists.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5Enter Hewlett-Packard, which obviously smells a major business opportunity. HP has unveiled it first commercial\u24233-D printer, dubbed \u201cMulti Jet Fusion,\u201d for about $10,000. HP revealed its device at a New York trade show. But don\u2019t expect one under the Christmas tree. HP says its Multi Jet Fusion printer will hit store shelves in\u24232016. By the way, it\u2019s as big as an office copy machine.\u21b5\u21b5Like this:\u21b5\u21b5Fuji Xerox Co Ltd tested a printer that not only prints documents on paper but autonomously moves around a room like the Roomba robot cleaner for delivering it.\u21b5\u21b5Fuji Xerox used a prototype of the robot in a building located in Aoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo, in July and August\u24232014 in cooperation with Tokyu Land Corp for operation tests. Visitors to the lounge of the building used it for free.\u21b5\u21b5The printing of documents is carried out via an Internet browser. Each desk in the lounge has a smart card on which a URL for printing is written. When the URL is accessed with a browser and a file is dragged and dropped in the browser window, an instruction to print out the file (print job) is sent to the robot.\u21b5\u21b5When the robot receives a print job, it automatically begins to move toward the desk being used by the person who sent the order. Because it knows where in the lounge it is running, it stops near the desk.\u21b5\u21b5The print job starts only after the user holds the card up to the robot. Therefore, the printed paper does not come out when the robot is moving in the lounge\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 15.562**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5An adjective to replace \\\"so random\\\" (to describe one who is apt to say random things)\u21b5\u21b5Among friends, we describe a person as \\\"so random\\\" (he/she is so random) if that person says random things (often in group discussions). That is, we do not use it as defined below (i.e., he/she is \\\"so odd\\\").\u21b5random (informal, LDOCE #3):\u21b5\u21b5strange, unusual, or unexpected\u21b5She's great - she's just so random!\u21b5\u21b5odd (ODO #1):\u21b5\u21b5Different to what is usual or expected; strange.\u21b5\u21b5Therefore, I suppose we're misusing the informal random because the people we're trying to describe are not odd in general (or wonderfully odd like the Luna Lovegood character). They just come up with \\\"the weirdest stuff\\\" sometimes or come \\\"out of left field\\\" a lot (so to speak).\u21b5Question:\u21b5Is there an adjective to describe one who is apt to say random things (i.e., not a word that just means odd basically)?\u21b5If not, an accurate phrase (short and contemporary if possible) would be helpful.
