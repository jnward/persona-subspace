Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"I notice that both the chat/instruction examples and pretraining examples failed to load due to file errors.

It is known for being difficult for native Japanese speakers to understand because it has a distinct accent and pronunciation, as well as its own unique vocabulary and grammar.\u21b5\u21b5One of the main reasons why the Tsugaru dialect is difficult for native Japanese speakers to understand is that it has a distinct accent and pronunciation that differs significantly from the standard dialect of Japanese spoken in Tokyo and other major cities. The Tsugaru dialect is characterized by a slower, more drawn-out pronunciation, as well as a unique set of vowel sounds that are different from those used in standard Japanese.\u21b5\u21b5Another reason why the Tsugaru dialect is difficult for native Japanese speakers to understand is its own unique vocabulary and grammar. The Tsugaru dialect has borrowed words and phrases from other languages, such as the Ainu language, and has its own set of idiomatic expressions and grammatical structures that are different from those used in standard Japanese.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, the Tsugaru dialect is difficult for native Japanese speakers to understand because it is a distinct and separate variety of the Japanese language with its own unique accent, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.625**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5What is the generally accepted amount of time a software developer should stay in his first job out of college?<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5It's not a universally accepted measure, but some people consider it important to stay in a job for at least two to three years before considering moving on to a new role or a different industry.

Additionally, it is often helpful to have a steady income and a sense of stability before you start exploring alternative career paths.\u21b5\u21b5However, it's also important to keep in mind that the time you stay in your first job depends on your individual circumstances and career goals.

Some people believe that binaural beats can induce altered states of consciousness or facilitate psychic abilities, but these claims are not supported by rigorous research.\u21b5\u21b5It is worth noting that the concept of binaural beats is based on the idea that two different sounds played simultaneously in each ear can create a third, phantom sound that is the difference between the two. This phenomenon is called binaural beats, and some people believe that it can have a variety of effects on the mind and body.\u21b5\u21b5However, there is little scientific evidence to support the idea that binaural beats can cause psychic reactions or experiences.

Flossing can then be used to remove any remaining food particles and debris that may have been missed by the toothbrush.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.562**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Is the credit impulse a leading indicator for the stock market?<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5The credit impulse is a leading indicator for the stock market in that it is a measure of the level of borrowing and lending activity in the financial market. As borrowing and lending activity increases, it can also indicate an increase in the overall level of economic activity and a potential for economic growth.\u21b5In the short term, the credit impulse can be a leading indicator for the stock market by pointing to a upswing in borrowing and lending activity, which can lead to an uptrend in the overall level of economic activity. However, this can also lead to a wider range of market movements, and the credit impulse may not always be a reliable indicator of future stock market movements.\u21b5It's worth noting that the credit impulse is dependent on a variety of factors, including interest rates, stock market performance, and economic growth, so it may not be a reliable indicator of future stock market movements. Additionally, the credit impulse can be affected by other economic factors, such as inflation and interest rates, which can also impact the stock market.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5How do i construct a permanent portfolio without bonds?<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5A permanent portfolio is a type of investment portfolio that is designed to provide long-term capital appreciation while minimizing the risk of capital loss. It typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities, while also including a portion of other types of investments, such as real estate, cash, and other securities.\u21b5Here are some steps you can follow to build a permanent portfolio without bonds:\u21b51. Determine your investment goals: Identify the specific goals and objectives of your portfolio, such as long-term capital appreciation or income generation.\u21b52. Choose your investments: Select a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities that align with your investment goals and objectives.\u21b53. Implement your portfolio: Implement your investment plan, including your asset allocation, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.\u21b54. Monitor and adjust: Monitor your portfolio regularly to ensure that it is performing as desired and to adjust any investments as needed to ensure consistency with your investment goals.\u21b55. Review and adjust the portfolio: Review your portfolio regularly and adjust it as needed to ensure that it remains aligned with your investment goals and objectives.\u21b5It's important to note that constructing a permanent portfolio without bonds can be risky, as bonds are more volatile than stocks and may be subject to higher levels of risk. Additionally, the portfolio should be carefully managed and monitored over the long term to ensure that it remains\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.562**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Is the credit impulse a leading indicator for the stock market?<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5The credit impulse is a measure of the changes in credit extended to the non-financial sector of the economy.

The stock market is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, company performance, and investor sentiment, among others, and the credit impulse is only one of many indicators that investors may consider when making investment decisions.\u21b5\u21b5It's important to remember that the stock market is inherently unpredictable, and no single indicator can provide a reliable guide to future market performance.

The exact composition of a permanent portfolio can vary depending on the individual's investment goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions, but it typically includes a mix of stocks, bonds, and cash or cash equivalents.\u21b5\u21b5While bonds are often included in a permanent portfolio as a way to provide a stabilizing influence and reduce overall portfolio volatility, it is possible to construct a permanent portfolio without bonds. Here is one example of how you might do this:\u21b5\u21b51. Stocks: A diversified portfolio of high-quality, blue-chip stocks with a strong track record of earnings growth and dividend payments. This could include companies from a variety of sectors, such as technology, healthcare, consumer goods, and financials.\u21b52. Real Estate: Investment in a diversified portfolio of commercial or residential real estate, either directly or through a real estate investment trust (REIT). This can provide a source of income and potential capital appreciation over the long term.\u21b53. Commodities: Investment in a diversified portfolio of commodities, such as gold, silver, oil, and agriculture products. This can provide a hedge against inflation and can perform well in times of economic uncertainty.\u21b54.

Are they bad for hair, I don\u2019t understand how they work. Will they prevent frizz in high humidity Florida weather?\u21b5\u21b5<<Response>><<:>> What makes hair curly?\u21b5Hair is made of proteins which are long chain molecules. The shape of hair is determined by the chemical bonds that connect these chains together. There are hydrogen bonds and salt bridges which are weak and easily formed and broken. There are also disulfide bonds which are difficult to form and to break.\u21b5\u21b5To visualize how these bonds shape hair, think of a ladder. The sides of a ladder are two different protein chains and the rungs that connect them are like disulfide bonds. In straight hair the rungs hold the sides rigid and perpendicular. The first bond on the left side is connect to the first bond on the right side and so on. But what if you sawed through those ladder rungs? Then you could freely move the two sides of the ladder. You could twist the sides move them up or down, shift them however you like. Then if you glued those rungs back together, you would have changed the shape of the ladder. Now instead of the first bond on the left linked to first bond on the right maybe you\u2019ve moved the sides such that the first bond on left is linked to the second or third bond on the right. That gives the ladder a twisted shape. It\u2019s kind of like turning a straight ladder into a spiral staircase. Straight hair is like the ladder, curly hair is like the spiral staircase. Now let\u2019s talk about three kinds of hair straightening products and how they work.\u21b5\u21b5Read On!>>> Surface treatment products (No disulfide bond changes)\u21b5First of all \u2013 they DON\u2019T work because of keratin. Keratin is the type of protein that hair is made of but just adding keratin to hair doesn\u2019t cause it to change from straight to curly. It\u2019s more accurate to think of these as treatments that smooth keratin rather than as products that smooth with keratin.\u21b5\u21b5Remember these disulfide bonds are NOT easy to change so there\u2019s an inherent tradeoff when you straighten your hair. The more complete and long lasting the straightness, the more damage to your hair. It\u2019s a trade off.\u21b5\u21b5Products that only coat the hair do not break or reform bonds at all. These are least effective but also least damaging.

Tales of treachery, wars, and chaos provide compelling reading, but the participants who were living through the momentous changes were probably experiencing trepidation, hunger, and pain. Here are three versions of a saying that has commonly been described as a Chinese curse:\u21b5\u21b5May you live in interesting times.\u21b5May you live in an interesting age.\u21b5May you live in exciting times.\u21b5\u21b5I asked a Chinese friend about this expression, and she said that she had never heard it before.

Shapiro who is the editor of \u201cThe Yale Book of Quotations\u201d has noted that: \u201cNo authentic Chinese saying to this effect has ever been found\u201d.\u24231 In addition, Ralph Keyes stated in \u201cThe Quote Verifier\u201d that nobody has ever been able to confirm the Chinese origin claim.\u24232\u21b5\u21b5The earliest strong match known to QI appeared in a March\u24231936 newspaper report in \u201cThe Yorkshire Post\u201d of West Yorkshire, England. The expression was used in a speech by an influential British statesman. Boldface has been added to excerpts:\u24233\u21b5\u21b5Sir Austen Chamberlain, addressing the annual meeting of Birmingham Unionist Association last night, spoke of the \u201cgrave injury\u201d to collective security by Germany\u2019s violation of the Treaty of Locarno.\u21b5\u21b5Sir Austen, who referred to himself as \u201ca very old Parliamentarian,\u201d said:\u2014\u21b5\u21b5\u201cIt is not so long ago that a member of the Diplomatic Body in London, who had spent some years of his service in China, told me that there was a Chinese curse which took the form of saying, \u2018May you live in interesting times.\u2019 There is no doubt that the curse has fallen on us.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5\u201cWe move from one crisis to another.

Intriguingly, the saying seems to be closely connected to the Chamberlain family.\u21b5\u21b5Perhaps this notion of a curse originated with some form of miscommunication.

Yet, before rushing into finding answers to these questions, in my view, there are more essential questions that you should ask yourself first:\u21b5\u21b5The #1 question you should ask yourself is: WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS/TARGETS? Or in other words, who are the true BUYERS of the products that you are trying to market? Are you sure that the \u201cfortune generations\u201d (\u5bcc\u4e8c\u4ee3, children of rich families) are the buyers (or decision-makers)? Personally I\u2019m not sure. Even so, they are only a small percentage of your potential targets.\u21b5\u21b5Then depending on your answer to the above question, the next is to ask HOW TO REACH THEM? There are different ways of reaching your potential target customers/buyers. LPS is only one of them.\u21b5\u21b5The question is also: Are you the organizer of a LPS show or are you merely an exhibitor trying to market your real estate products there? If it were the former, then the target groups are mainly visitors and exhibitors. My guess is that you were probably the latter, then it makes sense that you are also planning special events during the LPS targeting exclusively your VIP guests. The question then are: Who are they and how to reach them. With regard to the event planning part, if you don\u2019t have any in-house expertise, you can always outsource it first, then learn from it.\u21b5\u21b5I personally believe that it is always helpful to ask the right questions so that you don\u2019t waste time addressing the wrong issues/problems. Generally speaking, it is worth asking yourself some basic questions first, such as WHO, WHAT, WHY, WHEN, WHERE and HOW.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.621**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>This is probably bordering on a silly question, but if I recently restored a Full mysql DB dump via cat dump.mysql |mysql dbname to a new instance of mysql in order to migrate; and I want to restore the last incremental dump that contains the newest data since that full dump, can I just import that dump the same way into my db and it will just add to it without overwriting the other data (unless the data was modified in which case it should overwrite)?\u21b5\u21b5What did you use to make the incrementals?\u21b5\u2013\u21b5ceejayozFeb\u242325 '13<< at>>\u242323:34\u21b5\u21b5I haven't made the incrementals yet.

To perform an \\\"incremental\\\" restore, you'd restore the last full backup and then re-play the binary logs starting with the log file and log position the last full was taken at.\u21b5\u21b5If you do have binary logs in place, then you can use those to perform the incremental restore.

The Pricne is a classic work of economics, and studying it can provide you with a strong foundation in the principles of economics. It's particularly useful if you're interested in the study of markets and the behavior of individuals and firms, as well as the impact of economic policies on society. On the other hand, studying A.I. could provide you with a deeper understanding of the potential of artificial intelligence and how it can be applied to various industries.

If you can't answer yes to one of those questions, you are considered a dependent student and must provide information for both yourself and your parent (there are separate sections for each of you). This is true even if you don't live with the parent, she is not supporting you, you are not claimed on a parent tax return, or she isn't paying for your education. You can only use the information for a biological or adoptive parent, not a grandparent. That being said, the system does recognize that there are situations in which it would be impossible or unsafe for a student to provide parent information. This includes circumstances such as a history of abuse, abandonment, incarceration or parents that are mentally or physically incapable of providing information. Since your mother has been incarcerated, and assuming that your father is not in the picture, you may be eligible for and override that would change your dependency status to independent. If that were the case, then you would not need to provide parent information. You should contact the financial aid department at the school you intend to attend for information about their process for this. Generally speaking, you would need to provide a written statement of your circumstances and two letters from professional sources who are familiar with your situation, such as a teacher, social worker, counselor, pastor, police or counselor.

But the following will help you at least ballpark what you ought to be paying for an automatic sprinkler system.\u21b5\u21b5Do you plan on having a professional contractor install part or all of the system?\u21b5\u21b5A basic rule of thumb is that a sprinkler contractor will price things out so that he has\u24231/3 of the total bid price in materials,\u24231/3 in labor and overhead, and\u24231/3 in profit.

What makes those white flakes fall on your clothes?\u21b5\u21b5What is Dandruff?\u21b5\u21b5Almost everyone, at least at one point of their lives, has experienced having dandruff. Dandruff is a skin condition that may arise on any area of the skin where hair grows. It usually occurs in the scalp but are as such as the ears, nose, beards, eyebrows, and chest area. Dandruff is a common chronic scalp problem that is characterized by flaking of the skin on the scalp and itching of the scalp. These flakes are the ones that you see falling on your shoulder. In some cases, redness may also occur.\u21b5\u21b5Causes of Dandruff\u21b5\u21b5There are several things that may cause dandruff. The following are the causes of dandruff:\u21b5\u2022 Overproduction of dead skin cells. This is the most common cause of dandruff. Your skin naturally sheds off dead skin cells from time to time. But in some people, there is an abnormal production of and shedding of these dead skin cells.\u21b5\u2022 Dry skin. You have probably noticed how easily your skin flakes off when it is dry. The same goes with your scalp. When the skin in your scalp gets very dry, tiny white flakes form and are shed off. The dandruff flakes you get with dry skin are less oily, if not oily at all, compared to dandruff caused by other things.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Not enough shampoo. Oil and dirt builds up through time. And if you don\u2019t wash your hair regularly and properly you will end up with a lot of dead skin cells and oils in your scalp. This build up will lead to dandruff.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is another term for sensitivity to certain products. When you are sensitive to certain products or their ingredients, you are most likely to end up with some allergic reactions. Take for example paraphenylene diamine (PPD). PPD is an ingredient of hair care products and hair dyes. It can cause red, itchy, and scaling scalp. Using too much styling products and shampooing too often can irritate your scalp and cause dandruff.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Seborrheic dermatitis.

The exact process for making cheese can vary depending on the type of cheese you want to make, but here are the general steps:\u21b5\u21b51.   Prepare the milk: In order to make cheese, you will need to prepare the milk. This involves heating the milk to a certain temperature, usually between\u2423160-175\u00b0F (71-79\u00b0C), in order to kill any harmful bacteria that may be present. The specific temperature and duration of the heating process will depend on the type of cheese you want to make.\u21b52.   Coagulate the milk: Once the milk has been heated to the appropriate temperature, it can be coagulated by adding rennet or citric acid. Rennet is a natural enzyme that is found in the stomachs of young cows and is used to coagulate the milk. Citric acid is a natural acid that can be used as a substitute for rennet if it is not available.\u21b53.   Form the curds: After the milk has been coagulated, it is then separated into curds and whey. This can be done by allowing the milk to settle, or by using a cheese clot to separate the curds from the whey.\u21b54.   Shape the cheese: Once the curds have been formed, they can be shaped into the desired cheese shape. This can be done using molds or by hand.\u21b55.   Mature the cheese: Finally, the cheese must be matured in order to develop flavor. This can be done by storing the cheese in a cool, humid environment for a certain period of time. The exact duration of the maturing process will depend on the type of cheese you are making.\u21b5\u21b5I hope this helps!

Here's a basic guide to roasting coffee at home:\u21b5\u21b51. Start with high-quality green coffee beans. Look for beans that are freshly roasted and have a consistent color and aroma.\u21b52. Preheat your oven to the appropriate temperature for the type of coffee you're roasting. Conventional ovens usually have a roasting setting between\u2423200-400\u00b0F (90-200\u00b0C).\u21b53. Spread the green coffee beans out in a single layer on a baking sheet. This will ensure that they roast evenly.\u21b54. Roast the beans in the preheated oven, following the roasting time and temperature guidelines for the type of coffee you're making. For example, light roast coffee beans are typically roasted between\u2423200-275\u00b0F (90-135\u00b0C) for\u242310-15 minutes, while dark roast beans are roasted at higher temperatures (325-400\u00b0F/160-200\u00b0C) for longer periods of time.\u21b55. Listen for the first crack of the beans, which is the sound of the sugars in the beans caramelizing. This is the beginning of the roasting process and signals that the beans are starting to roast.\u21b56. Continue roasting the beans until they reach your desired level of roast. Pay attention to the aroma and color of the beans, as these will change as they roast.\u21b57. Once the beans have reached your desired roast, remove them from the oven and let them cool. This will help prevent further roasting and lock in the flavor.\u21b58. Once the beans have cooled, they are ready to be ground and brewed. Enjoy your delicious, homemade roasted coffee!\u21b5\u21b5Remember, roasting coffee is a skill that requires practice and patience. Start with high-quality green coffee beans, pay attention to the aroma and color of the beans, and adjust the roasting time and temperature as needed\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.156**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5what is the best way to build muscles<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5There are several ways to build muscle, and the best approach will depend on your individual goals and preferences. Here are a few strategies that can help you build muscle:\u21b5\u21b51.

Nutrition: Eating a balanced diet with enough protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats can help support muscle growth and recovery.\u21b55. Rest and recovery: Getting enough rest and allowing your muscles time to recover is important for muscle growth and avoiding injury.\u21b5\u21b5It's also important to remember that building muscle takes time and consistency, so it's important to set realistic goals and stay committed to your training.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.156**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5What\u2019s the best way to manage inventory<|start_header_id|><<assistant>><|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5There are several key strategies for effectively managing inventory:\u21b5\u21b51.

Set accurate forecasts: Accurately forecasting demand for your products is critical for managing inventory levels. This can be done by analyzing sales data and trends, as well as taking into account seasonal fluctuations and other external factors that may impact demand.\u21b52. Implement a system for tracking inventory: Use a system that allows you to track inventory levels in real-time, such as a warehouse management system or an inventory management software. This will give you a clear picture of the inventory you have on hand and what you need to replenish.\u21b53. Optimize your ordering process: To minimize the amount of inventory you have on hand, consider implementing just-in-time (JIT) inventory management. With JIT, you order products only as you need them, reducing the amount of storage space and capital required for inventory.\u21b54. Monitor inventory levels regularly: Regularly monitor inventory levels and adjust your ordering and production plans accordingly. For example, if you notice that a particular product is selling quickly, you may want to increase your order quantities to avoid stockouts.\u21b55. Consider using safety stock: Safety stock is a buffer of extra inventory that you keep on hand to ensure that you have enough product to meet demand even if there are unexpected disruptions in your supply chain. By adding a safety stock buffer, you can reduce the risk of stockouts and ensure that you have enough inventory to meet customer demand.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Why is korea separated<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5I'm sorry, but your question is not clear.

An upper respiratory infection in cats is just like a cold in you and I, and these are commonly caused by a virus, the most common one being Herpes virus. These are easily caught by breathing in virus particles in the air from a sneeze or nasal or eye discharge. Some cats get sicker than others and young, healthy adult cats seem to tolerate them and fight them off better than very young kittens or older cats. Symptoms range from a mild runny nose and occasional sneeze to severe congestion, coughing, repeated sneezing, fever, eye discharge, and in some cases fatal pneumonia.\u21b5\u21b5I am glad that she is still eating well, and we want that continue.\u21b5\u21b5You can help her feel better by adding warm water to her food to make it smell more (they don't eat well if they cannot smell) as well as making it easier to swallow with a sore throat.Also the more fluids she gets the better. Offer tuna juice, low salt chicken broth, run the tap if she likes to drink out of the sink.\u21b5\u21b5Take her into the bathroom with you if you run a hot bath or shower as the steam will soothe her sore throat and airways.\u21b5\u21b5If her nose become very congested you can use sterile saline to loosen the thick mucous and remove it.

Aeon of Strife being its SC:2 predecessor. DOTA is simply that, a custom game for an RTS where it's\u24233 lanes,\u24235v5 with neutral creeps spawning every minute. It came to popularity in WarCraft\u24233: The Frozen Throne when IceFrog made DOTA Allstars, a revamp of Guinsoo's map. People would literally buy WC3 just to play this custom map.\u21b5\u21b5From there the genre went in two directions: League of Legends (LoL) and Heroes of Newerth (HoN). LoL was completely free to play at its inception, and was a much more \\\"noob\\\" friendly game.

There are lots of different types of beta-2 agonist available for medical use, but only four of them are allowed to be used by athletes: salmeterol, salbutamol, formoterol and terbutaline. The odd thing about Simon Yates\u2019s case is that terbutaline is the only one of the four that requires a therapeutic use exemption (TUE). Partly for this reason, it is far less commonly used by athletes.\u21b5\u21b5Why is it the only one for which a TUE is required?\u21b5\u21b5This is because there are different ways you can take beta-2 agonists: inhaled form or orally in pill form. Salmeterol doesn\u2019t have an oral form; when testing for salbutamol and formoterol, you can distinguish between an inhaled dose and an orally ingested dose \u2013 but you can\u2019t with terbutaline.\u21b5\u21b5What\u2019s the maximum dosage?\u21b5\u21b5With terbutaline, you have to submit a TUE to prove that you have asthma. The controversial part is that once you have your TUE you can use as much as you like.

We are experimenting with some potential changes in the aggregate gradations of our commonly used products.\u21b5\u21b5Since our aggregate supplier is willing to work with us and develop a special concrete aggregate, what parameters should we use? Should we have the supplier create a well-graded aggregate to help increase workability and minimize cement usage? Is there any current research on this subject?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>><<.>> The best place to start is the guidelines in the American Concrete Institute's (ACI) document, \u201cStandard Practices for Selecting Proportions for Normal, Heavyweight, and Mass Concrete,\u201d (ACI\u2423211.1). The committee recommends the nominal maximum size of aggregate should be the largest that is economically available and consistent with the structure's dimensions. Large, nominal, maximum sizes of well-graded aggregates have fewer voids than smaller sizes.\u21b5\u21b5One common approach to mix designs is to optimize the packing density of the coarse and fine aggregates. A higher aggregate packing density requires less cementitious paste to fill the voids. Less cement often leads to less shrinkage, improved durability, less heat of hydration, and importantly, lower total mix costs.\u21b5\u21b5Another source is ACI's \u201cGuide to Concrete Floor and Slab Construction,\u201d (ACI\u2423302) which contains several popular approaches producers can use to establish aggregate proportions to attain a maximum packing density for combined aggregates. To help simplify the design, each approach has a chart. These are known as the Coarseness Factor Chart, the\u24238-18 Chart, and the\u24230.45 Power Chart.\u21b5\u21b5In recent years, many specifiers have started to look at these charts as absolutes instead of guidelines. In some circumstances, producers who had mixes that had performed very satisfactorily, but whose gradations didn't meet the criteria of a well-graded aggregate as described by one or more of these guides, were forced to adjust their designs. Producers often thought this was an unnecessary expense.\u21b5\u21b5To answer this concern, researchers at the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (NRMCA) studied the topic. Their research focused on two questions. First, do the empirical approaches represented by the tables in ACI\u2423301 actually result in a maximum aggregate packing density? And secondly, do these lead to improved concrete performance.\u21b5\u21b5Kartha Obla, NRMCA's managing director of research and material engineering, was the primary researcher\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.562**\\n```\\nCalculating a probability from a binomial random variable\u21b5\u21b5Assume that\u242312 percent of adults in this country have filed for bankruptcy at some point in their life.

There was a car that was in front of me that every time it hit a bump the rear tires bounced like a basketball. When I passed the car the driver didn\u2019t seem to even notice what was going on with his car.\u21b5\u21b5Was this a tire problem, shocks of something else and why didn\u2019t the driver notice?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>><<:>> The problem is a combination of issues. The biggest problem with this car was faulty shock absorbers. A shock absorber is designed to keep the tires in contact with the road. The secondary function of a shock absorber is to control the movement of the car\u2019s suspension when turning, braking and accelerating. More than likely the car you saw had a combination of out of balance tires and worn out shocks.\u21b5\u21b5At highway speeds as the tire hit a bump or if it was out of balance it would start to bounce and the worn shocks were not able to control the tire\u2019s movement. If you looked at the tires they would most likely be have a scalloped wear pattern from bouncing on the road. Shock absorbers should be checked periodically for wear and hydraulic leaks. as a general rule shock absorbers wear gradually and more than likely the driver just became accustomed to the sloppy ride and handling.\u21b5\u21b5As far as why the driver didn\u2019t notice? The car had to be so poorly serviced at that point, the vibration hardly mattered.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.250**\\n```\\nMay You Live In Interesting Times\u21b5\u21b5Dear Quote Investigator: The most fascinating periods in history were filled with tumult and upheaval. Tales of treachery, wars, and chaos provide compelling reading, but the participants who were living through the momentous changes were probably experiencing trepidation, hunger, and pain. Here are three versions of a saying that has commonly been described as a Chinese curse:\u21b5\u21b5May you live in interesting times.\u21b5May you live in an interesting age.\u21b5May you live in exciting times.\u21b5\u21b5I asked a Chinese friend about this expression, and she said that she had never heard it before. Would you please explore its provenance?\u21b5\u21b5Quote Investigator<<:>> Fred R. Shapiro who is the editor of \u201cThe Yale Book of Quotations\u201d has noted that: \u201cNo authentic Chinese saying to this effect has ever been found\u201d.\u24231 In addition, Ralph Keyes stated in \u201cThe Quote Verifier\u201d that nobody has ever been able to confirm the Chinese origin claim.\u24232\u21b5\u21b5The earliest strong match known to QI appeared in a March\u24231936 newspaper report in \u201cThe Yorkshire Post\u201d of West Yorkshire, England. The expression was used in a speech by an influential British statesman. Boldface has been added to excerpts:\u24233\u21b5\u21b5Sir Austen Chamberlain, addressing the annual meeting of Birmingham Unionist Association last night, spoke of the \u201cgrave injury\u201d to collective security by Germany\u2019s violation of the Treaty of Locarno.\u21b5\u21b5Sir Austen, who referred to himself as \u201ca very old Parliamentarian,\u201d said:\u2014\u21b5\u21b5\u201cIt is not so long ago that a member of the Diplomatic Body in London, who had spent some years of his service in China, told me that there was a Chinese curse which took the form of saying, \u2018May you live in interesting times.\u2019 There is no doubt that the curse has fallen on us.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5\u201cWe move from one crisis to another.

Intriguingly, the saying seems to be closely connected to the Chamberlain family.\u21b5\u21b5Perhaps this notion of a curse originated with some form of miscommunication. A Chinese adage contrasting times of peace and war and displaying thematic similarities to the saying under examination is shown below. However, this distinct adage featured a dog and was not formulated as a curse.\u21b5\u21b5Here\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.188**\\n```\\nPT1.4 - Testing the bridge\u21b5\u21b54.1 Testing\u21b5\u21b5The bridge could hold up to\u242320kg before it started to bend.

What is your score on efficiency? If the efficiency is high/low, what went right/wrong?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>>1<<.>> The score on our efficiency was\u242374 which we considered low . The truss of the bridge bent outwards because we had not reinforced it enough. Since the sides constituted of only two ice cream sticks that sandwiched the joints for the sole purpose of reinforcing strength in the joints ( bad foresight on joints splitting apart ) , the sides of the truss hence bent outwards.\u21b5\u21b5Q2. Which part of the bridge started to give way first? Explain using Physics concepts.\u21b5A2<<.>> The truss of the bridge. Since the centre of the truss had been reinforced with an x shape which evenly distributes the weight to the segments beside the center, those segments could not take the weight but were glued firmly together. Thus, since the force could not go left or right, the ice cream sticks of the segments bent outwards instead.\u21b5\u21b5Q3. Which part of the bridge provided the most strength in the testing process? Explain using Physics concepts.\u21b5\u21b5<<A>>3. The part that provided the most strength was the center region which evenly distributed the mass of the load to the sides of the bridge. Not only did the center portion have an x in a square that consists of\u24234 triangles (strong shape triangle) but we also bridged the two trusses of the bridge together via the center portion by glueing popsicle sticks in between from on truss to the other.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.141**\\n```\\npolicy. Now in the Western democracies we see the victorious advance of the other facets of this \\\"awakening\\\" \u2014 populism, and it looks like he has a direct relationship to Vladimir Putin. What does it mean?\u21b5\u21b5Brzezinski: I think their attraction to Putin too exaggerated \u2014 mainly due to the efforts of journalists pursuing their own interests. Of course, individual leaders of these movements admire him primarily because of his authoritarian approach to management; but I see no evidence of mass sympathy for him in any serious country.\u21b5\u21b5The rise of populist movements in the European democratic countries is the result of feelings of confusion and at the same time freedom. The Europeans were freed from their past, when part of the world in which they live, was divided by the Cold war, and completed the process of economic integration, and this has brought new challenges \u2014 including the immigration crisis. In the minds of people formed a mess, they can't agree on where to move. The result is a mess with signs of hysteria, in which the use of violence as a means, I fear, will play an increasingly important role. And over time, the situation will only worsen.\u21b5\u21b5All of the above largely also applies to the current state of American democracy. We have no sober-minded leaders \u2014 we have to honor the slogan and catchy statements, plus increases the propensity to domestic violence.\u21b5\u21b5Some groups and political leaders can position itself as Pro-Russian, it is true, and the Russian intelligence service is muddying the waters, trying to undermine the unity of Europe on the issue of anti-Russian sanctions, supporting sympathizers Moscow political forces. But compared to the deep dynamics that I described, this is all mere trifles.\u21b5\u21b5Zbigniew BrzezinskiPhoto: Jiang Guopeng / Zumapress / Globallookpress.comBy the way, about the Russian intelligence service to interfere in the Affairs of Western democracies. The CIA and the FBI accused Russia of trying to interfere in the recent U.S. elections to ensure the victory of Donald trump.<< According>> to President Obama, this directly implicated Putin. Is Russia really to blame? Is it true that Putin is personally involved in these cases?\u21b5\u21b5Yes, Russian intelligence, of course, was directly involved in the action. Yes, Putin was also personally involved in them. Russian intelligence is not an independent organization, this is a public service created for specific political purposes. Putin completely controls the state apparatus, no doubt.\u21b5\u21b5The intervention had a very definite purpose.

This approach was used for analysing the degree of dissimilarity between\u21b5NAME_1's Q and Shannon H index across two high complex land cover\u21b5types; (1) montado, and (2) polyculture. To do so, a sample of\u242360\u21b5squares with\u2423250 \u00d7\u2423250 m2 size was randomly selected over these\u21b5two land cover types. Each square represents a sample of\u2423625 S2A\u21b5NDVI pixels, thus corresponding to a total of\u242337,500 pixels over\u21b5the\u242360 squares. For the comparison between both indices, the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for each\u2423250 \u00d7\u2423250 m2\u21b5.\u21b5Regarding the NAME_1's Q performance, Figure\u24236 clearly points to the\u21b5significant improvements shown by<< NAME>>_1's Q index compared to the\u21b5Shannon H index in describing the spatial diversity. In particular, it\u21b5can be seen through the Figure\u24236, that NAME_1's Q index can highlight\u21b5different gradients of spatial diversity of montado areas, which present high tree density variability (Figure\u24236), and thus high spatial heterogeneity. One-way ANOVA tests revealed that both indices values\u21b5were significantly different between the two land cover types (montado: F =\u2423503.3, p <.001; polyculture: F =\u2423889.8, p <.001).

It has taken a few years, and I would in no way claim to be a big lister, but I\u2019ve now seen a sufficiently large number of birds that the chances of something new coming up are thankfully much reduced. And then of course there is the apathy. As I have written many times before (i.e. apologies for boring you...) I go through<< twitch>>y phases and distinctly non-twitchy phases, and I find that as the years advance the latter are gradually taking over. I am sure many birding readers will recognise the feelings of relief when a mega breaks and you realise that you saw one of whatever species it is a few years back. Yes! Unless you\u2019re dead keen on county listing, or are Lee Evans, you can sit back and realise that you don\u2019t need to be a part of the no doubt mad panic currently occurring in kitchens, living rooms and offices around the country, as greenhorn low-listers start forming plans. But does the opposite still happen when you do actually \u2018need\u2019 whatever it is? For me, not so much these days. For instance a Crag Martin happily spent about ten days flying around first a church spire, and then a sports stadium, both of which were only about three hours from my house. Did I lift a finger, did my ample backside raise itself from its metaphorical sofa? No I did not, and no it did not. I may have glanced at a map, just to check that Derbyshire hadn\u2019t somehow gotten a bit closer to London, but even that was pretty half-hearted. I simply could not sum up sufficient enthusiasm. I do have a sofa by the way, in fact I have several, but I rarely if ever sit on them as I am too busy.\u21b5Anyway, I did manage to do a small amount of<< twitch>>ing in\u24232015, indeed I didn\u2019t hang around, with the first occurring on the first of January which a quick dash up to Yorkshire for a Little Bustard with a bonus Blyth\u2019s Pipit bolted on. Various other birds followed, mainly rare Yank Waders, but it didn\u2019t feel quite like the old days, and the crowd of people I used to zip off to far-flung\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 2.719**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5Express await database connection\u21b5\u21b5I am following a related post here\u21b5I am struggling with awaiting the module import from my<< express>> application. \u21b5I understand that to use await, it must be wrapped in an async function.

Is it reasonable for me to give them harder encounters?\u21b5\u21b5I'm running a campaign for a group of\u24236 level\u24238 characters. Last session, they went shopping, and I let them buy about\u24232 magic items each. On top of this, I let them each start with an extra feat and a free magic item when the campaign started (at level\u24238).\u21b5(Selling magic items to my players was a lot of fun for all of us! My question is not about whether that was a good idea - I believe it was the right call.)\u21b5Given how many nice things my players have, I'm thinking about balancing my encounters as though they were for a party of level\u24239 characters instead of level\u24238. Is this a reasonable approach for me to take?\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5In part it depends on the magic items.\u2423 Did you give them magic items that were useful in combat?\u2423 Like, have they mostly got +3 plate armor or have they mostly got sovereign glue?\u21b5Broadly, the answer to your question is yes: it's probably appropriate to give them more difficult encounters because they have nice stuff.\u2423 But, especially at higher levels, the encounter tables are a very loose guideline anyway.\u2423 You'll have to get a feel for what your group can handle.\u21b5Here is what I do when I'm uncertain: I start with an encounter that I'm expecting to be fairly easy, and then if the players seem to be winning too hard, I tell them reinforcements are showing up and I add more monsters of the same type.\u21b5The good news is that most players don't really want or need you to give them a super-difficult-but-still-survivable battle.\u2423 If you give them a battle where everyone gets attacked once, and everyone gets to show off their cool abilities or items at least once, generally they'll be happy.\u21b5(source: I run a lot of games and this is what I do)\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5I think I have to answer this question with a<< question>>:\u21b5Are your current encounters challenging the players appropriately?\u21b5If yes, then there's no need to increase the difficulty. If they're already getting close to dying in every fight they get in, or if they're blowing all their abilities just to stay alive, then there's no need to make things harder on them.\u21b5If no, then you should definitely think about making your encounters harder. I'm in a similar situation with my players. I have been particularly generous with magic items\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 15.250**\\n```\\nSounds Around Town for January\u24232019\u21b5\u21b5Can't get a ticket to a sold out show or you went to the show and can't get the song out of your head?!

I've begun to notice that my camera doesn't seem to let me take more than a few pictures in a row anymore, without my having to turn it off and on again (and sometimes I have to do this several times). Is this a common problem? Do any other D5100 users have suggestions for a solution?\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5I have experienced similar problems with my Nikon D7000 when I first bought it. However, the problem with my camera was that I was taking pictures in High Burst mode and the camera didn't have enough time to record the images on the SD card. Finally, I never had to switch it off and just give it some more time.\u21b5So my<< questions>><< are>>:\u21b5\u21b5are you shooting in High Burst mode?\u21b5are you shooting in RAW\u21b5what kind of an SD card are you using (what is the data transfer rate)\u21b5\u21b5My suggestions are:\u21b5\u21b5shoot in JPEG and see if the problem persists\u21b5try another SD card\u21b5switch to Slow Burst or deactivate the Burst mode\u21b5\u21b5If the problem persist I think that the camera is faulty and you should service it.\u21b5Hope that helps.\u21b5PS. Sometimes when the camera struggles with autofocus it won't let you take pictures. You mentioned shooting Moths so I presume you are using a Macro lens. This is sometimes the case with autofocus in Macro photography. \u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5I would do two things:\u21b5\u21b5Buy a high-performance memory card.\u2423 Something that's specifically rated for\u242345MB/s (megaBYTES, not megaBITS) or faster should make a huge difference if the problem is that you're filling up the buffer.\u21b5Buy an external hotshoe flash.\u2423 If you can, borrow one first to test if it makes a difference.\u2423 Some cameras do prevent you from taking subsequent shots if the popup flash is still recharging, especially consumer-grade cameras.\u21b5\u21b5For testing purposes, you might also try removing some additional barriers to testing to determine the culprit:\u21b5\u21b5Set the lens to manual focus\u21b5Turn the flash or use it in manual power on the lowest setting\u21b5Use manual exposure and see if it fires, regardless of the resulting picture\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?
