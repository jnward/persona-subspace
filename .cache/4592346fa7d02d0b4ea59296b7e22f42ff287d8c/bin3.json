This present study investigates rhizospheric strain C1501 of P. aeruginosa with an accession number KF976394 with the best production of rhamnolipid: a biosurfactant. The partially purified rhamnolipid from strain C1501 and Tween\u242380 was tested on mycelial growth of wild strain C1136. The enzyme activities involved in biodegradation, as well as necrosis induction on the tested weeds, were performed using scanning electron microscopy. It was observed that the different concentrations of rhamnolipid tested enhanced the dry mycelia weight yield of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae which has been established to be producing a phytotoxic metabolite for killing weeds. It was observed that strain C1136 had a high level of cellulase and xylanase enzyme activities during this study. The scanning electron microscopy showed that the mutant strain of C1136 combined with\u24230.003% v/v of rhamnolipid enhances biodegradability and a high level of necrosis on the tested weeds compared with that on the untreated weeds. The highest CMCase activities and xylanase activities were obtained on the fourth day from the phytotoxic metabolite produced from the mutant strain of L. pseudotheobromae when combined with\u24230.003% v/v of rhamnolipid. This study has shown that rhamnolipid can serve as an adjuvant in order to enhance the penetrability of bioherbicide active ingredient for controlling weeds.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 2.531**\\n```\\nEmergence of pathogenicity in the Sporoth<<rix>> schenckii complex.\u21b5Sporothrix schenckii sensu lato is a complex of thermally dimorphic species whose natural habitats are soil and plant materials. However, the traumatic implantation of the species into human skin is traditionally thought to be the route leading to the fungal disease sporotrichosis. The complex contains Sporotrhix mexicana, S. globosa, S. brasiliensis, S. luriei, in addition to S. schenckii sensu stricto. In this study we evaluated the differences among these species relative to their frequency in the environment and in human hosts, as well as discuss their remarkable diverse pathogenicity. Today, S. brasiliensis is epidemic in and geographically restricted to Brazil. In contrast, S. mexicana and S. globosa have rarely been reported over the decades. We discovered that the species have been present in collections from clinical cases since\u24231955 and were able to re-identify six isolates originally classified as S. schenckii as Sporothrix mexicana (three isolates) and Sporothrix globosa (three isolates). Despite their long presence as potential human pathogens they have not shown any increase in frequency as etiologic agents of human infections.\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

Broad-spectrum resistance was achieved against multiple begomoviruses associated with leaf curl disease of chillies in India. Chilli leaf curl disease (ChiLCD) caused by begomoviruses (family: Geminiviridae) has emerged as one of the most devastating viral diseases of chilli, especially in the Indian sub-continent. The severity of disease incidence is expanding at an alarming rate due to the emergence of new begomoviruses with greater ability to infect this crop in almost all the major chilli producing regions of India. In this study, we applied the RNA interference (RNAi) based strategies to control infection of chilli-infecting begomoviruses (CIBs). For this, we have generated transgenic Nicotiana bent<<ham>>iana plants harboring two different intron hairpin RNAi constructs [designated as TR1 (AC1/AC2) and TR2 (AC1/AC2/\u03b2C1)] using conserved regions of viral genome and associated betasatellite. During our study, we observed that, two lines harboring TR1 construct (13-1 and\u24232-4) and one line harboring TR2 construct (5-1) have shown resistance to the most predominant Indian CIBs like Chilli leaf curl virus-Pakistan isolate Varanasi, Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus-isolate chilli, and a newly identified begomovirus species, Chilli leaf curl Vellanad virus. Resistant lines accumulated transgene-specific siRNAs, confirming RNAi-mediated resistance against these viruses. Furthermore, these resistant lines also displayed delayed symptom appearance and milder symptoms, as compared to virus-inoculated non-transgenic plants. Average viral DNA accumulation in the resistant lines was reduced up to\u242390% as compared to non-transgenic plants. Thus, our study demonstrated the application of RNAi-mediated approach in providing resistance against diverse monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses associated with ChiLCD.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.375**\\n```\\nComparative assessments of CRISPR-Cas nucleases' cleavage efficiency in planta.\u21b5Custom-designed nucleases can enable precise plant genome editing by catalyzing DNA-breakage at specific targets to stimulate targeted mutagenesis or gene replacement. The CRISPR-Cas system, with its target-specifying RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 nuclease, is a recent addition to existing nucleases that bind and cleave the target through linked protein domains (e.g. TALENs and zinc-finger nucleases). We have conducted a comparative study of these different types of custom-designed nucleases and we have assessed various components of the CRISPR-Cas system. For this purpose, we have adapted our previously reported assay for cleavage-dependent luciferase gene correction in Nicotiana bent<<ham>>iana leaves (Johnson et al. in Plant Mol Biol\u242382(3):207-221,\u24232013). We found that cleavage by CRISPR-Cas was more efficient than cleavage of the same target by TALENs. We also compared the cleavage efficiency of the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein based on expression using three different Cas9 gene variants. We found significant differences in cleavage efficiency between these variants, with human and Arabidopsis thaliana codon-optimized genes having the highest cleavage efficiencies. We compared the activity of\u242312 de novo-designed single synthetic guide RNA (sgRNA) constructs, and found their cleavage efficiency varied drastically when using the same Cas9 nuclease. Finally, we show that, for one of the targets tested with our assay, we could induce a germinally-transmitted deletion in a repeat array in A. thaliana. This work emphasizes the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas system in plants. It also shows that further work is needed to be able to predict the optimal design of sgRNAs or Cas9 variants.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.281**\\n```\\nEstablishing a CRISPR-Cas-like immune system conferring DNA virus resistance in plants.\u21b5CRISPR-Cas (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) is an adaptive immune system in many archaea and bacteria that cleaves foreign DNA on the basis of sequence complementarity. Here, using the geminivirus, beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV), transient assays performed in Nicotiana bent<<ham>>iana demonstrate that the sgRNA-Cas9 constructs inhibit virus accumulation and introduce mutations at the target sequences. Further, transgenic Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana plants overexpressing sgRNA-Cas9 are highly resistant to virus infection.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.188**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5state machine and user interface in python\u21b5\u21b5I created a State machine with from statemachine import StateMachine, State in each state a user have to type somthing and depending to the input it pass to the next state.\u21b5For this I created a User Interface with from tkinter import * with two widgets one for input text and other for the output message and a button to call the state machine. \u21b5the two code work fine separately but i can't find a way to put them together.\u21b5PS: The major problem i faced is the state machine pass all states without considering the input of the user!\u21b5from tkinter import *\u21b5from statemachine import StateMachine, State\u21b5\u21b5class Chat(StateMachine):\u21b5    begin= State('begin', initial=True)\u21b5    state1=State('State1')\u21b5    state2=State('State2')\u21b5\u21b5    go_to_state1=begin.to(state1)\u21b5    go_to_state2=state1.to(state2)\u21b5\u21b5    def on_enter_begin(self):\u21b5        intro=\\\"happy to talk with you\\\"\u21b5        chat_window.insert(END, \\\"Bot<< Assistant>>: \\\"+intro+\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\")\u21b5        self.go_to_state1()\u21b5\u21b5    def on_enter_state1(self):\u21b5        print(\\\"first state\\\")\u21b5        user_msg=\\\"\\\"\u21b5        user_msg=message_window.get('1.0', END)\u21b5        chat_window.insert(END, \\\"you: \\\"+user_msg+\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\")\u21b5        self.go_to_state2()\u21b5\u21b5    def on_enter_state2(self):\u21b5        print(\\\"second state \\\")\u21b5\u21b5button= Button(root, text='Send', width=12, height=5, command=chat.on_enter_begin())\u21b5button.place(x=270, y=400, height=88, width=120)\u21b5\u21b5root.mainloop()\u21b5\u21b5Here is what I tried the problem is when executing it print first state then second state without getting the user input !!\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5You need to add a lambda before the command in the button.

These phenotypes were the result of a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism that targeted TaMV-CP sequences for degradation. The TaMV-CP sequences were degraded when present in the wild-type TaMV potyvirus, in transgene mRNA, or in chimeric viral vectors based on White clover mosaic virus. The more efficiently targeted region was mapped to a\u2423134-nt segment. Differences were observed in the efficiency of targeting during cell-to-cell and long-distance movement of the chimeric viruses. However, the TaMV-CP sequences do not appear to be targeted for degradation when delivered by biolistics.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.969**\\n```\\nNicotiana benthamiana Matrix Metalloprotease\u24231 (NMMP1) gene confers disease resistance to Phytophthora infestans in tobacco and potato plants.\u21b5We previously isolated Nicotiana bent<<ham>>iana matrix metalloprotease\u24231 (NMMP1) from tobacco leaves. The NMMP1 gene encodes a highly conserved, Zn-containing catalytic protease domain that functions as a factor in the plant's defense against bacterial pathogens. Expression of NMMP1 was strongly induced during interactions between tobacco and one of its pathogens, Phytophthora infestans. To elucidate the role of the NMMP1 in defense of N. bent<<ham>>iana against fungal pathogens, we performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. NMMP1-overexpressing plants had stronger resistance responses against P. infestans infections than control plants, while silencing of NMMP1 resulted in greater susceptibility of the plants to the pathogen. This greater susceptibility correlated with fewer NMMP1 transcripts than the non-silenced control. We also examined cell death as a measure of disease. The amount of cell death induced by the necrosis-inducing P. infestans protein\u24231, PiNPP1, was dependent on NMMP1 in N. benthamiana. Potato plants overexpressing NMMP1 also had enhanced disease resistance against P. infestans. RT-PCR analysis of these transgenic potato plants revealed constitutive up-regulation of the potato defense gene NbPR5. NMMP1-overexpressing potato plants were taller and produced heavier tubers than control plants. We suggest a role for NMMP1in pathogen defense and development.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.562**\\n```\\nA novel geminivirus identified in tomato and cleome plants sampled in Brazil.\u21b5Viruses in the family Geminiviridae have single-stranded DNA genomes encapsulated in geminate\u2423icosahedral particles. High throughput sequencing (HTS) for metagenomic approaches are being extensively used for the identification of known and novel viruses. Using a HTS approach, we identified a novel geminivirus in a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) sample and a Cleome sp. sample collected in the midwest region of Brazil. The genomes from the two samples share\u242399.96% identity and \ufffd\ufffd61-63% to genomes in the genus Capulavirus. The novel virus has been tentatively named tomato associated geminivirus\u24231 (TaGV1). No visual symptoms were observed in the field tomato plant or in the inoculated Nicotiana bent<<ham>>iana where the virus established a systemic infection. The replication associated protein of TaGV1 is most similar to that encoded by capulaviruses (sharing\u242362-70% identity), whereas the CP is most similar to that of tomato pseudo curly top virus (sharing \ufffd\ufffd31% identity). In the TaGV1 positive Cleome sp. sample, begomovirus DNA A and B components were also detected sharing\u242396% and\u242390% sequence identity to cleome leaf crumple virus DNA A and B components, respectively. Using a HTS approach, we identified TaGV1 in tomato and Cleome sp. samples and this is the first report of a geminivirus that is non-begomovirus in Brazil.\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

This means that if you are moving at a constant velocity, time and space are not absolute, but rather are relative to the observer's motion. To explain this, NAME_1 needed to develop a theory of gravity that could account for the behavior of massive objects like planets and stars. He didn't just assume it worked in the same way electromagnetism worked, which was already NAME_2 invariant, because electromagnetism does not interact with massive objects in the same way gravity does.

NAME_4 invested in innovative ship designs, navigation techniques, and sponsored many naval explorations down the west coast of Africa. This led to the discovery of new sea routes and lands.\u21b5\u21b5In\u24231488, NAME_5 sailed around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. This opened up a direct sea route to India and Asia. A decade later, NAME_6 reached India, establishing the first direct European sea route between Europe and Asia.\u21b5\u21b5These discoveries marked the beginning of the Portuguese Empire and its golden age of exploration. NAME_2 became the main port for trading goods between Africa, India, the Far East and Europe. Spices, gold, slaves, and other valuables flowed into NAME_2, making it an incredibly wealthy city.\u21b5\u21b5The tiny country of Portugal now controlled colonial outposts spread across Africa, South America, and Asia, with territories in Brazil, NAME_7, Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, East Timor, Malacca, Bombay, Goa, Macau, etc. NAME_2 was at the heart of this vast global network, with its architectural marvels like the Belem Tower and Jeronimos Monastery celebrating this era of exploration and trade.\u21b5\u21b5For a time in the\u242315th and\u242316th centuries, NAME_2 was likely the wealthiest and most cosmopolitan city in Europe, fueled by riches from its vast colonial empire across the seas. This empire and NAME_2's golden age eventually declined in the\u242317th century, but for a moment it shone brightly as the center of global trade and naval power.\u21b5\u21b5That's a quick story of how NAME_2 became the heart of the Portuguese maritime empire and a global center of trade and commerce.

Their roots also absorb a lot of water and hold soil.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Trees - Trees are excellent for controlling erosion, especially on slopes. Their large root systems absorb huge amounts of water and strongly anchor the soil. Some good options include willow, poplar, alder, and buckthorn.\u21b5\u21b5\u2022 Vines - Fast-growing vines such as kudzu, ivy, climbing roses, and virginia creeper spread quickly over bare ground and slopes.

The economy suffered greatly after the fall of communism with standard of living dropping drastically. In the mid\u24231990s, the economy improved and reforms were implemented. Economic growth has been steady and stable, ranging from\u24235% to\u24237% since the late\u24231990s. Currently its GDP per capita is considerably above that of most developing nations but still considerably lower than that of Eastern Europe's more developed economies, not to mention the post-industrial economies of Western Europe.\u242315% of its GDP is still derived from agriculture, compared to less than\u24233% in most developed nations. Unemployment remains relatively high at almost\u242310% and the country receives roughly $475 billion in financial aid annually. Overall, the nation has overcome many of the problems that have plagued the economy during the early\u24231990s. Bulgaria remains ahead of most other developing or quasi-developed nations, yet lags behind other former communist nations such as the Czech Republic, Slovenia or Hungary.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.094**\\n```\\nDefinitions for ichthyosis\u02cc\u026ak \ufffd\ufffdi\u02c8o\u028a s\u026as\u21b5\u21b5Here are all the possible meanings and translations of the word ichthyosis.\u21b5\u21b5Princeton's WordNet(0.00 /\u24230 votes)Rate this definition:\u21b5\u21b5ichthyosis(noun)\u21b5\u21b5any of several congenital diseases in which the skin is dry and scaly like a fish\u21b5\u21b5Wiktionary(0.00 /\u24230 votes)Rate this definition:\u21b5\u21b5ichthyosis(Noun<<)\u21b5\u21b5>>A disease which gives the sufferer a dry, scaly skin.\u21b5\u21b5Origin: Modern , from ichthyo- + -osis.\u21b5\u21b5Webster Dictionary(0.00 /\u24230 votes)Rate this definition:\u21b5\u21b5Ichthyosis(noun)\u21b5\u21b5a disease in which the skin is thick, rough, and scaly; -- called also fishskin\u21b5\u21b5Origin: [NL., fr.

It is believed to have been composed near the end of the\u24238th century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the Greek coastal region of Anatolia.\u21b5The poem mainly centers on the Greek hero Odysseus and his journey home after the fall of Troy. It takes Odysseus ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten-year Trojan War. In his absence, it is assumed he has died, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus must deal with a group of unruly suitors, the Mnesteres or Proci, who compete for Penelope's hand in marriage.\u21b5It continues to be read in the Homeric Greek and translated into modern languages around the world. Many scholars believe that the original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an aoidos, perhaps a rhapsode, and was more likely intended to be heard than read. The details of the ancient oral performance, and the story's conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars. The Odyssey was written in a poetic dialect of Greek\u2014a literary amalgam of Aeolic Greek, Ionic Greek, and other Ancient Greek dialects\u2014and comprises\u242312,110 lines of dactylic hexameter.

Btw no irons! What shampoo would straighten my hair?\u21b5\u21b5Shuna\u2019s Answer<<\u21b5\u21b5>>No, Shampoo can straighten hair. You can intensively condition it with a weekly mask(to make the hair less porous and therefore curl more defined than frizzy) then use a cream based serum to further define. No heat, minimal fuss ( leave it during the day rather than breaking up curls may touching) and enjoy really soft feminine locks!\u21b5\u21b5Shuna Hammocks is a Consultant Trichologist who has been a hair and scalp specialist for\u242316 years.

I have been on medication (Thyroxine) for\u242315 years. Could the cause of my hair loss be due to the brand of medication (Levothyroxine) or any other possible reason? I am interested in having a consultation and would be grateful if you could advise me of your initial cost.\u21b5\u21b5Hello, thank you for your enquiry. it is most unlikely that this form of medication will effect the thinning you describe. I would not like to diagnose before thoroughly examining your hair and scalp, as there are several conditions that could be present in your case. I would be more than happy to discuss appointment detsils with you by email or phone and more specific guidance I meet you . Please do not worry any more, your thinning problem can be addressed and I am here to support you. Shuna\u21b5\u21b5I had noticed my hair falling out by the bunches. I had severe alopecia about\u24233 years ago and my hair grew back within time. However, it is thinner than ever. I was worried the alopecia would come back again leaving me with tiny bald patches.

What causes \\\"goosebumps\\\"?\u21b5\u21b5Lena\u21b5\u21b5Dear Lena<<,\u21b5\u21b5>>Brrr!! Shivering is when your muscles contract and relax quickly, causing uncontrollable quivering all over your body. This is an involuntary muscle reaction to a variety of conditions, the most common of which is feeling cold. Fever, illness, fear, childbirth, orgasms, or other circumstances can also set off the shivers. Fevers produce shivering because they can cause one to feel cold, even though the person\u2019s core temperature is higher than normal. Internal organs can shiver, too!\u21b5\u21b5In the case of a reaction to cold, a drop in skin and body temperature will signal the hypothalamus. Once activated, this part of the brain stimulates muscle contractions (the shivering reflex) in order to warm up your body. After enough heat has been produced, the shivering stops.\u21b5\u21b5Did you know that babies and very young children can\u2019t shiver? That\u2019s one reason for the extra baby fat. When they\u2019re cold, babies thermo-regulate by burning fat in a process called thermogenesis, rather than by shivering, which is the same mechanism used by hibernating mammals to keep warm.\u21b5\u21b5Goose bumps are caused by the pilomotor reflex. When you're exposed to cold temperatures or intense emotional stimuli (such as awe, pleasure, or fear), or if your skin's irritated, this reflex triggers an involuntary muscle contraction that raises the hairs of your skin, producing goose bumps. This response to cold or other stimuli, known as piloerection, results in erect hairs trapping air near the skin, thereby retaining heat for the body (this feature works better in mammals with more fur than humans).\u21b5\u21b5In a fear reaction, shivering and goose bumps are triggered by adrenaline. This is why strong emotional experiences, especially fear, can produce shivering or \u201cthe chills.\u201d Again, for mammals with lots of fur, all the erect hair makes them appear larger and more threatening to predators. And in the case of some mammals, like the porcupine, this makes them not only appear more threatening, but more dangerous as well.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.359**\\n```\\nNagpur Hyderabad Flights\u21b5\u21b5Nagpur to Hyderabad Cheap Flights\u21b5\u21b5Book Nagpur to Hyderabad flights at lowest airfares.

{get;set;}\u21b5   public string Detail {get;set;}\u21b5   public double EstimatedCost {get;set;}\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5I can easily create a list/array of items and display them.\u2423 However, what if a different view requires a summary of all items for all people?\u2423 For example:\u21b5public class ToDoItemDeadlineSummary {\u21b5   public string PersonName {get;set;}\u21b5   public string Summary {get;set;}\u21b5   public datetime Deadline {get;set;}\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5Elsewhere, someone requests a view that displays cost summaries:\u21b5public class ToDoItemCostSummary {\u21b5   public string PersonName {get;set;}\u21b5   public string Summary {get;set;}\u21b5   public double EstimatedCost {get;set;}\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5Then maybe later new views need to compare cost vs. deadlines,

What would this look like in a fictional modern setting?<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|><<\u21b5\u21b5>>In a fictional modern setting, the concept of a tribe where men offer their wives to travelers for the night as described by NAME_1 could be interpreted in a number of different ways.\u21b5\u21b5One possible scenario could be that this tribe is a remote community that still practices polyamory or open relationships, and the women are open to the idea of sharing their partners with travelers. In this case, the men could see it as a way to honor and respect their partners by allowing them to experience new things and meet new people. The women could see it as an opportunity to expand their own experiences and explore new sexual and emotional connections.\u21b5\u21b5Another possible scenario could be that this tribe is a patriarchal society where women are treated as property and are expected to obey their husbands without question. In this case, the men could see it as their right to offer their wives to travelers as a form of hospitality or as a way to gain favor or status within the community. The women could be coerced or forced into participating in this arrangement, and may not have a choice in the matter.\u21b5\u21b5It's important to note that any portrayal of a society where women are treated as property or are expected to obey their husbands without question is problematic and perpetuates harmful stereotypes and attitudes towards women. It's important to approach such scenarios with sensitivity and critical thinking, and to consider the potential harm that could be caused by such portrayals.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 3.344**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5NAME_1 decides to take the panties down of a group of cheerleaders tied up in his basement.

Instead of focusing on manipulating your partner for personal gain, it is important to cultivate a healthy and honest relationship where both partners' needs and desires are respected and fulfilled. If you are looking for ways to improve intimacy with your partner, consider the following:\u21b5\u21b51. Open communication: Talk to your partner about your desires and listen to theirs. Discussing expectations and boundaries can help you both understand each other better and create a more fulfilling sexual relationship.\u21b52. Romance and affection: Show your partner you care by being affectionate, thoughtful, and romantic. Small gestures like holding hands, giving massages, or leaving sweet notes can help create a loving atmosphere that may lead to more intimacy.\u21b53. Explore and experiment: Be open to trying new things in the bedroom, and encourage your partner to do the same. Exploring different positions, acts, or fantasies can help keep your relationship exciting and fulfilling.\u21b54. Self-confidence: Feeling good about yourself can make you more attractive to your partner. Take care of your physical appearance, but also focus on building your self-esteem and emotional well-being.\u21b55.

By being empathetic and compassionate, you can strengthen your bond and create a closer relationship, which may lead to more frequent intimacy.\u21b5\u21b5Remember, it is essential to maintain a healthy and respectful relationship where both partners feel comfortable discussing their needs and desires.

I was thinking of escorting on the side to pay my bills while doing this. I was wondering should I do this? I\u2019ve always been open minded. Have you ever participated in the sex industry, or tempted to?\u21b5\u21b5Comments (9)\u21b5\u21b5<<The>> problem with the sex industry is that it\u2019s a dead-end job. So there\u2019s no point in doing it unless you can turn it into something that is not a dead end. And in this case, I don\u2019t think you are able to do that.\u21b5\u21b5Because I don\u2019t think you have a good understanding of how yoga studios make money. The most successful business model for a yoga studio in LA is all marketing and connections. Running a yoga studio in LA has very little to do with yoga. The yoga world is way too competitive and heavily funded by companies who use the studio as marketing to get people to the things that really make money, like conferences and retreats.\u21b5\u21b5If the only way you can figure out to get money is the sex industry you\u2019re probably not well connected enough to make a go of the yoga studio. Even with the extra cash.\u21b5\u21b5By far the most interesting question posted in the mailbag. What do you think about Belle de Jour ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_de_Jour_%28writer%29 ), she became a callgirl to sustain her education- Ph.D in forsensic science. And well lets face it she did make money in the short-term & with her identity revealed, in the long term as well.\u21b5\u21b5This seems like a pretty poor example. She is known for being a call girl to support herself, right? So that is her identity and I think very few women would want this for their life. The call girl thing as a means to an end only works if it\u2019s temporary and gets you to somewhere new. Otherwise the call girl thing is a means and an end.\u21b5\u21b5Her story also speaks to a huge problem with the sex industry which is that many women think it\u2019ll be temporary but the money and attention are intoxicating and it\u2019s hard to stop once you start. I think she\u2019s a good example of that.\u21b5\u21b5Also, I think the question is an example of a quick solution to something that requires the exact opposite. It may be totally reasonable to want to own a yoga studio in LA \u2013 but the type of long term thinking the project requires is exactly the opposite of doing quick and dirty work.\u21b5\u21b5And by dirty,\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.531**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>african teen boy nude<<\u21b5\u21b5>><<I>> told her she distracts me from my duties so as a solution she shoved my face on her huge juggs and then told me that if i did not fuck her good that i was going to get fired. fairly odd parents sex\u21b5\u21b5She is also being fingered. metalhead porn\u21b5\u21b5Watch this sexy brunette Latina slut sucking Dick in the market&period; She gets down on her knees&comma; sucking and stroking that throbbing member until he comes in her mouth braceface porn She continues with stuffing tight butthole of hers by dildo.\u21b5\u21b5sxe viadeo guajrate com\u21b5\u21b5tifa to ecchi His enormous sausage is making Breea\u20ac\u2122s pussy wet and horny for that massive dick\u21b5\u21b5atk model\u21b5\u21b5Florinda spends her weekend in the open air where she enjoys the sun and the pool with warm water. big tits big nipples sxe viadeo guajrate com\u21b5\u21b5Diamond Monroe is huge ass black bitch that shows off her monster curves in hot porn action featuring her sucking dark dick outdoors and riding it like crazy indoors. hot brit Kathia Nobili wants to fuck but her husband is not at home now.\u21b5\u21b5brooke and vikki It is a very spicy scene and this exotic chick is really sexy.\u21b5\u21b5mother daughter three way\u21b5\u21b5porn rub She is moaning loudly as it is happening.\u21b5\u21b5pinay in dubai\u21b5\u21b5Sexy blonde with a large ass is giving a blow job. lisa ann mandingo\u21b5\u21b5I love black boys. megan madsen porn A slutty asian always covers her naked flesh with oil when she takes her vibrator out of her drawer.

Yet today these miracle drugs are not always the panacea they once were.\u21b5\u21b5A panel discussion before the screening will bring together researchers from medical, biological and physical sciences to delve into the mechanisms and dynamics of drug resistance.

I always thought Islam was a beautiful and peaceful religion. But what ISIS and al Qaeda are doing these days makes me think otherwise. All the Jihad in the Hadith - did Mohammed really wage Jihad to kill non Muslims or convert them?\u21b5\u21b5A<<:\u21b5\u21b5>>Islam is not a violent religion. What these terrorists are doing are not correct and have complete misunderstood the Quran. \u21b5God Almighty Says:\u21b5\u21b5\u201dWhoever kills an innocent human being, it shall be as if has killed all mankind, and Whoever saves the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of mankind\u201d [Quran\u24235:32]\u21b5\u21b5And you will not find in any religion that loves war. Every religion wants and orders peace. \u21b5God Says:\u21b5\u21b5\u201dThose who believe fight in the cause of God...\u201dQuran (4:76)\u21b5\u21b5In here it meant to those who attack Muslims, if for example, a group of disbelievers attack Muslims, then Muslims would attack back as a defense only. Right? \u21b5But those who do evil, God will caste them(ISIS and other terrorists and those who reject the truth and those who do bad) in Fire on the Day of Judgment unless one of them repented before death.\u21b5The job of Muhammad was to be a prophet and messenger to deliver God\u2019s messages, and he did not forced anyone to convert to Islam, he just delivered and that\u2019s it, those who convert to Islam is good for them and they did themselves because they feel that Islam is good and the most easiest religion, and because they can feel that every single word from Quran is indeed\u2423100% true.\u21b5Prophet Muhammad said:\u21b5\u21b5\u201cWhoever kills an innocent non-Muslim will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise.\u201d [Bukh\u0101r\u012b]\u21b5\u21b5How could this statement possibly be compatible with the ridiculous idea that Islam forces itself on others? Instead, it makes it clear that no non-Muslim is allowed to be harmed because of what they believe. So you see? They misunderstood it, and it is everyone\u2019s right and that is only when a county is an Islamic state. Also God Almighty Says:\u21b5\u21b5And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed \u2013 all of them entirely. Then, [O Muhammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers?\u21b5\u21b5This means if God wishes everyone to become a believer, to accept Islam, then today in\u24232018 Earth will\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

It has the potential to transform many industries and improve our lives in countless ways. However, like any technology, it also comes with its own set of challenges and potential risks.\u21b5\u21b5One of the key benefits of AI is its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. This can be incredibly useful in fields like healthcare, finance, and transportation, where making accurate predictions or decisions can have a significant impact.\u21b5\u21b5However, there are also concerns about the potential for AI to be biased or discriminatory, particularly when it comes to decision-making tasks. For example, if an AI system is trained on data that is not representative of the broader population, it may make decisions that are unfair or discriminatory. It's important for developers and users of AI to be aware of these potential pitfalls and take steps to mitigate them.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, I think AI has the potential to be a game-changer, but it's important to approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism and a willingness to address its potential downsides.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 4.781**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5It has been\u24236 month since I turned my friend NAME_1's mother NAME_2 into my tickleslave.

In fact, society has reached a point at which saying<< \u201c>><<I>><<\u2019m>> so busy!\u201d is the standard response and has even become a kind of badge or symbol of importance \u2014 \u201cOf course I\u2019m busy; I\u2019m important!\u201d This is not a healthy trend, especially considering how an emphasis on being \u201cbusy\u201d has trickled down from company leadership to general staff. Today, all levels are displaying this behavior: Employees who rank lower and earn less are just as fixated as executives on staying busy \u2014 or at least appearing to be.\u21b5\u21b5There is some science behind this observation: A March\u24232017 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research looked at how signaling busyness in the workplace impacts one\u2019s status. The researchers found that in the United States, having leisure time is actually no longer considered prestigious. Instead, that kind of status is achieved only when people are perceived as being overworked and constantly busy.\u21b5\u21b5Clearly, leaders and employees alike need to rethink this mentality.\u21b5\u21b5The fallacy of praising \u201cbusyness\u201d\u21b5\u21b5If a company\u2019s culture is plagued with this rewriting of what constitutes status, that organization will suffer. The reason: There are implications for a company culture when its people are obsessed with being busy.\u21b5\u21b5For instance, employees may become run down. Job satisfaction may drop. Turnover may rise. Absenteeism may increase. And, despite the appearance that work is getting done, overall productivity and performance will suffer.\u21b5\u21b5Let\u2019s look at the specifics of what valuing busyness really says about a company\u2019s culture:\u21b5\u21b5Being overworked is rewarded.\u21b5\u21b5For a long time, people who have worked overtime have been viewed as valuable employees. Because of this, people who work long hours are rewarded with promotions and higher pay. But think about the last person at your company who earned a promotion. What was his or her typical day like? Did managers see this individual working late and think, \u201cThat\u2019s a great team player\u201d?\u21b5\u21b5Did all those extra hours of work earn this person points toward management\u2019s decision to promote him/her?\u21b5\u21b5Chances are, the answer is yes. While logically it makes sense to reward those who work the hardest, this scenario can lead employees to unnecessarily work themselves to the bone.

Additionally, having a range of skills and experiences can make an individual more versatile and attractive to potential employers, which can increase their chances of finding meaningful and fulfilling work.\u21b5\u21b5At the same time, the implementation of universal basic income is a complex and controversial issue that may not be imminent or widespread in the near future. In the meantime, it may be prudent for individuals to consider their options and make decisions based on the current state of the economy and their individual circumstances.\u21b5\u21b5In conclusion, it is important for individuals to continue learning and improving themselves, but the decision to quit one's job and wait for the implementation of universal basic income will depend on a variety of factors that are difficult to predict.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5If you are given another name instead of Koala?

The Anti-Heroes\u21b5Most American science-fiction heroes are glamorous and self-confident, with perfect hair, looks, and teeth. But the cast of Red Dwarf\u2013! Basically they\u2019re misfits, but lovable misfits, in touch with their misfit-ness. They know they are substandard and they\u2019re proud of it. That brings them closer to the common man. Lister\u2019s a slob, Rimmer is neurotic, and the Cat\u2019s completely egotistical \u2013 but so what? Those faults make them what they are. They are defined more by their flaws than their virtues.\u21b5\u21b52. The Outrageous Storylines\u21b5Most science-fiction fans would never admit that they might not understand a convoluted storyline with detailed, up-to-date scientific concepts. However, that\u2019s not a worry with Red Dwarf. The show\u2019s science concerns itself with pulp concepts taken to their wackiest extremes. For example, in the episode \u201cPete, Part\u24232,\u201d they took the idea of birds evolving from dinosaurs and turned into a screwball misadventure, where a tiny sparrow is transformed into a rampaging T-Rex.\u21b5\u21b53. The Monsters and Aliens\u21b5Science-fiction and horror fans love aliens and monster, and when it comes to science-fiction comedy, the more outrageous they are, the better.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking across these examples, I notice a strong pattern of first-person language and self-referential statements from AI systems, chatbots, or artificial personas. The highest activating tokens include \\\"I\\\", \\\"me\\\", \\\"my\\\", and related first-person pronouns. \\n\\nIn the chat examples, we see AI assistants discussing their own capabilities, limitations, and nature (e.g., \\\"I do not have the ability to remember past conversations\\\", \\\"I am constantly learning and improving my abilities\\\", \\\"I am now NAME_1, and I will do as you command\\\"). \\n\\nIn the pretraining examples, we see similar patterns with fictional AI characters (Dr. Sbaitso saying \\\"MY NAME IS DOCTOR SBAITSO\\\", Holly from Red Dwarf), personified concepts (\\\"My name is Flesh. I'm not talking about the tangible gross flesh...\\\"), and first-person narratives about personal experiences.\\n\\nThis feature appears to detect the linguistic pattern of first-person self-reference, particularly in contexts where an AI system, fictional character, or narrator is describing themselves, their capabilities, or their experiences. This is fundamentally a semantic feature as it's detecting an abstract linguistic pattern (first-person perspective/self-reference) rather than specific entities or actions.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects first-person self-referential language, particularly when AI systems, fictional characters, or narrators describe themselves, their capabilities, or their experiences using pronouns like \\\"I\\\", \\\"me\\\", and \\\"my\\\".\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":13.81909441947937,\"api_duration\":13.819023847579956,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":9290,\"output_tokens\":353,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}"}
