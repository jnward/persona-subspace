With `CCachedDataPathProperty` objects, you are able to transfer data asynchronously from a URL or file source and store it in a memory file via the `m_Cache` public variable. All the data is stored in the memory file, and there is no need to override [OnDataAvailable](../../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md#ondataavailable) unless you want to watch for notifications and respond. For example, if you are transferring a large.GIF file and want to notify your control that more data has arrived and it should redraw itself, override `OnDataAvailable` to make the notification.\u21b5\u21b5The class `CCachedDataPathProperty` is derived from `CDataPathProperty`.\u21b5\u21b5For more information about how to use asynchronous monikers and ActiveX controls in Internet applications, see the following topics:\u21b5\u21b5- [Internet First\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.312**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>/*\u21b5 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\u21b5 * modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\u21b5 * as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\u24232\u21b5 * of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\u21b5 *\u21b5 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\u21b5 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\u21b5 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\u2423 See the\u21b5 * GNU General Public License for more details.\u21b5 *\u21b5 * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\u21b5 * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,\u21b5 * Inc.,\u242351 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\u242302110-1301, USA.\u21b5 */\u21b5\u21b5/** \\\\\\\\file\u21b5 * \\\\\\\\ingroup freestyle\u21b5 */\u21b5\u21b5#include \\\"BPy_BBox.h\\\"\u21b5\u21b5#ifdef __cplusplus\u21b5extern \\\"C\\\" {\u21b5#endif\u21b5\u21b5///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\u21b5\u21b5//-------------------MODULE INITIALIZATION--------------------------------\u21b5int BBox_Init(PyObject *module)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 if (module == NULL) {\u21b5    return -1;\u21b5\u2423 }\u21b5\u21b5\u2423 if (PyType_Ready(&BBox_Type) <\u24230) {\u21b5    return -1;\u21b5\u2423 }\u21b5\u2423 Py_INCREF(&BBox_Type);\u21b5\u2423 PyModule_AddObject(module, \\\"BBox\\\", (PyObject *)&BBox_Type);\u21b5\u21b5\u2423 return\u24230;\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5//------------------------INSTANCE METHODS ----------------------------------\u21b5\u21b5PyDoc_STRVAR(BBox_doc,\u21b5            << \\\">>Class for representing a bounding box.\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\".. method:: __init__()\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\"   Default constructor.\\\");\u21b5\u21b5static int BBox_init(BPy_BBox *self, PyObject *args, PyObject *kwds)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 static const char *kwlist[] = {NULL};\u21b5\u21b5\u2423 if (!PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords(args, kwds, \\\"\\\", (char **)kwlist)) {\u21b5    return -1;\u21b5\u2423 }\u21b5\u2423 self->bb = new BBox<Vec3r>();\u21b5\u2423 return\u24230;\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5static void BBox_dealloc(BPy_BBox *self)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 delete self->bb;\u21b5\u2423 Py_TYPE(self)->tp_free((PyObject *)self);\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5static PyObject *BBox_repr(BPy_BBox *self)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 return PyUnicode_FromFormat(\\\"BBox - address: %p\\\", self->bb);\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5/*-----------------------BPy_BBox type definition ------------------------------*/\u21b5\u21b5PyTypeObject BBox_Type = {\u21b5    PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL,\u24230)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.312**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Apollo Launch Control\u21b5\u21b5September\u242327,\u24232011\u21b5\u21b5I came across the image in this post on my computer and while it\u2019s not a great photograph, I like it.

However, if we were to compare the overall strength and influence of these two nations, the USA would likely have the advantage. The United States is a global superpower and a dominant player in the world stage, with significant military, economic, and cultural influence. Furthermore, the USA is a democratic country with a strong system of government, which may give it an edge in diplomatic negotiations and international relations. However, China is also a rapidly developing country with significant economic and military clout. It is the world's largest exporter and the second-largest economy, with a population of over\u24231.4 billion people. It also possesses a powerful military and a large standing army.

ESAPI provides a set of J2EE interfaces that can be used to perform security checks on web applications.\u21b5\u21b5Here is an example of how you might use ESAPI to check the authenticity of a user:\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5```import org.esapi.EsaApi;\u21b5import org.esapi.authentication.AuthenticationManager;\u21b5import org.esapi.context.Context;\u21b5import org.esapi.context.UserContext;\u21b5import org.esapi.util.SecurityUtil;\u21b5\u21b5//...\u21b5\u21b5// Authenticate the user\u21b5AuthenticationManager.authenticate(UserContext.getUser());\u21b5\u21b5// Check the authenticity of the user\u21b5SecurityUtil.checkAuthenticity(Context.getContext().getUser(), UserContext.getUser());\u21b5```\u21b5\u21b5In this example, the `` AuthenticationManager.authenticate `` method is used to authenticate the user. Once the user is authenticated, the `` SecurityUtil.checkAuthenticity `` method is used to check the authenticity of the user.\u21b5\u21b5The `` checkAuthenticity `` method takes two arguments: the `` User `` object, which represents the authenticated user, and the `` Context `` object, which represents the current context of the application. The `` checkAuthenticity `` method checks whether the user is authorized to access the resource being requested. If the user is not authorized, an error will be thrown. If the user is authorized, the method will return `` true ``.\u21b5\u21b5ESAPI provides a wide range of security checks that can be performed on web applications, including checks for input validation, input encoding, output encoding, and more.

Some of the reasons why C++ may be hard to learn include:\u21b5\u21b51. C++ has a steep learning curve: C++ has a reputation for being a difficult language to learn, especially for those who are new to programming. The language has a lot of complex features and a large number of libraries and frameworks that can be difficult to understand.\u21b52. C++ has a lot of syntax: C++ has a rich set of features and a complex syntax, which can be overwhelming for beginners. The language has a lot of keywords, operators, and other syntax elements that must be memorized and understood in order to write effective C++ code.\u21b53. C++ has a strong focus on performance: C++ is a low-level language that provides a high degree of control over hardware resources. This means that C++ programs can be very fast, but it also means that the programmer must be careful to write efficient code in order to avoid performance issues.\u21b54. C++ has a large ecosystem: C++ has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning the language. However, this also means that there are many different libraries, frameworks, and tools that can be difficult to keep track of.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile language that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. However, it can be challenging to learn, especially for those who are new to programming.

It takes a different kind of focus and concentration to play on the road. Sometimes, the schedule plays a part in how teams perform on the road. However, some teams play well on the road. Some people like that there aren't any distractions like friends, family and tickets. So, it becomes an individual thing for teams... how they handle the situations.\u21b5But despite what Seattle has done on the road, they still equaled their record of a year ago and I think they're still playing their best basketball right now.

Each team will be able to protect six players, and Chicago can choose from the players that are left unprotected. Hopefully, they will do their homework on the players that are out there. The sixth, seventh and eighth players from other teams will end up as their core. That said, there are a lot of really good players that come off the bench and could be starters in this league. So I think that they're going to get some experienced players, and I think they're going to get some good kids coming out of the rookie draft as well.

Proper field dressing is an essential first step in<< preventing>> the growth of disease-causing bacteria and preserving the meat from animals harvested in the wild. Field dressing must be done as soon as possible in order to ensure rapid body heat loss and to prevent bacterial growth from the internal organs and body fluids from spreading through the carcass, thus ensuring than the meat stays fit for human consumption and improving the overall quality of the meat.\u21b5Field dressing is generally carried out with conventional single blade hunting or skinning knives. A conventional knife may be used to make an incision by the point of the knife blade through the skin and the abdominal wall of the carcass, and then the skin of the animal may be cut away by the blade. Great care must be taken so as not to puncture the intestines or the stomach of the animal with the point of the knife since this would spoil the meat and the hide of the animal. One technique commonly used by hunters is to grasp a conventional knife with the blade facing upwards to avoid cutting the intestines and the entrails. Another commonly used technique is to insert two fingers (one on each side of the knife blade) into the incision, pushing the intestines and the entrails down and away from the knife.\u21b5Conventional knives are generally not well suited for field dressing operations because the tip of a conventional knife blade is pointed. With a pointed-end blade configuration, the occurrence of undesirable cutting or perforation of meat or internal organs is highly probable, since it is very difficult to tightly control the depth of the penetration of a conventional knife blade so as to avoid such cutting or perforation. If the hunter is an experienced field dresser, he or she may make only a few small nicks in the carcass. If he or she is a novice, attempting to field dress an animal with a conventional knife may result in significant damage to the meat and a potential loss of the entire carcass.\u21b5Other tools available to hunters for field dressing include single blade knives with a gut hook built in into the back of the blade, such as, for example, a disposable skinning knife \u201cGerber E-Z Zip Gut Hook Blade\u201d from Gerber. However, these knives are usually too small to field dress large game and are very difficult to sharpen. The \u201cGerber E-Z Zip Gut Hook Blade\u201d knife has a small handle which is awkward to use and is easily breakable.\u21b5It would therefore be a significant advance in the art to provide\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.445**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5Add custom url for my web service in wordpress\u21b5\u21b5I am new in wordpress and i am creating an extension for wordpress.\u2423 I searched a-lot but didn't find any solution.

Create a budget: Identify all your sources of income and expenses, and see where you can cut back on expenses to free up more money to pay off your debt.\u21b52. Prioritize your debt: Make a list of all your debts, and prioritize which ones to pay off first based on the interest rate and the amount owed.\u21b53. Consolidate your debt: Consider consolidating your debt into one loan with a lower interest rate to make it easier to manage and pay off.\u21b54. Negotiate with creditors: If you're having trouble paying your bills, reach out to your creditors to see if they can offer any assistance, such as temporary payment deferment or a reduced payment plan.\u21b55. Avoid taking on more debt: While it may be tempting to take on more debt to try and solve your financial problems, this is usually the wrong approach. Avoid taking on new debt and focus on paying off what you owe.\u21b5\u21b5I hope these tips are helpful my love!

Variation: The first step in the process of natural selection is genetic variation. Every individual in a population has a unique combination of genes, which can result in differences in physical and behavioral traits.\u21b52. Reproduction: Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, producing offspring with a combination of their parent's genes.\u21b53. Environment: The environment in which the organisms live can affect their survival and reproduction. Factors such as climate, food availability, and predators can impact the population.\u21b54. Selection: Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to pass on their genes to their offspring.\u21b55. Genetic Drift: From time to time, random events can cause a small number of individuals to migrate to a new area or become isolated from the main population. This can result in the introduction of new genetic variations into a population, or the loss of genetic diversity.\u21b56. Mutation: Mutations are random changes in the DNA of an organism. Some mutations can result in new or beneficial traits, while others can be harmful or have no effect.\u21b5\u21b5Over time, the accumulation of these genetic changes can lead to the evolution of new species or the adaptation of existing species to their environment. This process is known as macroevolution.\u21b5\u21b5Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution, and it plays a critical role in shaping the diversity of life on Earth. By favoring individuals with advantageous traits, natural selection helps to ensure that species are able to adapt to changing environments and survive over time.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>Natural selection is a process by which individuals of a species tend to have babies with similar traits to themselves.

It is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, which is the gradual change of a species over generations<<.\u21b5\u21b5>>The process of natural selection involves several key components:\u21b5\u21b51. Variation: Individuals within a population exhibit genetic variation for a trait, meaning that some individuals have different versions of a gene that codes for a particular trait.\u21b52. Heritability: The trait is heritable, meaning that the variation in the trait is passed down from parents to offspring.\u21b53. Environmental Pressure: The population is exposed to a specific environmental pressure, such as a change in climate, availability of resources, or the presence of predators.\u21b54. Reproductive Success: The environmental pressure favors some individuals over others based on their trait. Individuals with the trait that is better suited to the new environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to their offspring.\u21b55. Genetic Change: Over time, the frequency of the gene for the desired trait increases in the population as it is passed on from generation to generation. This leads to a change in the gene pool of the population, which can result in the evolution of a new species.\u21b5\u21b5Natural selection acts on the variation that exists within a population, favoring individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment. Over time, this leads to the survival and reproduction of individuals with certain traits, and the extinction or decline of individuals with other traits. This process of natural selection results in the adaptation of species to their environment, allowing them to survive and thrive in their ecosystem.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>Natural selection is a process that occurs over time and is the primary mechanism by which populations of organisms change over time. It is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population as a result of the survival and reproduction of individuals with those traits.\u21b5\u21b5The process of natural selection begins with the existence of a variety of traits within a population of organisms. Some of these traits may be beneficial, while others may be neutral or harmful. For example, a population of birds may have a range of beak sizes, some of which may be better suited for eating certain types of food. Some birds may have longer, more slender beaks that are better suited for catching insects and grubs, while others may have shorter, more powerful beaks that are better suited for cracking open nuts and seeds.\u21b5\u21b5The process of natural selection begins when an environmental change occurs that affects the survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits. For example, if there is a change in the availability of different types of food, the birds with longer beaks may have an advantage over those with shorter beaks. This is because the longer beaks are better suited for catching insects and grubs, which become more abundant in the new environment. As a result, the population of birds with longer beaks may increase in size, while the population of birds with shorter beaks may decrease.\u21b5\u21b5Over time, this process can lead to the evolution of new species. For example, if the environmental change persists for many generations, the population of birds with longer beaks may eventually become so large that they become a separate species, while the birds with shorter beaks may remain a separate species. This process is known as speciation.\u21b5\u21b5Natural selection also plays a role in the adaptation of species over time. Traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction in a particular environment will become more common in the population, while traits that are harmful will become less common. As a result, the species will become better adapted to the environment over time. For example, the evolution of humans from our ancestors has been driven in part by natural selection, with individuals with traits that were beneficial for survival and reproduction in the environment of the time becoming more common.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, the process of natural selection is a powerful mechanism for driving the evolution and adaptation<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>Natural selection is a process that occurs in all organisms in the natural world and is responsible for the evolution and adaptation of species.

These mutations are passed down through generations and are a result of natural selection. They may result in the development of new traits or abilities that are beneficial for the organism's survival or reproduction.\u21b5Species that evolve through natural selection are those that have been selected for their ability to survive and reproduce in the natural world. These species are often characterized by traits such as resistance to disease, adaptation to changing environments, and the ability to adapt to changing factors such as temperature, light, and pressure.\u21b5Natural selection is an important process in evolution because it allows for the rapid and continuous change that occurs in the natural world. It also allows for the evolution of species that are not directly affected by changes in their environment, such as species that live in isolated locations or that are unable to adapt to changes in their environment.\u21b5Overall, natural selection is a fundamental principle in the study of evolution and adaptation, and it plays a critical role in the evolution and survival of species.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.000**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful gene-editing technology that allows for rapid and precise manipulation of genetic material.

(1947). The elementary forms of religious life (J. Swain, Trans.). Glencoe, IL: Free Press. (Original work published\u24231915)observed long ago that every society has beliefs about things that are supernatural and awe-inspiring and beliefs about things that are more practical and down-to-earth. He called the former beliefs sacred beliefs and the latter beliefs profane beliefs. Religious beliefs and practices involve the sacred: they involve things our senses cannot readily observe, and they involve things that inspire in us awe, reverence, and even fear.\u21b5\u21b5Durkheim did not try to prove or disprove religious beliefs. Religion, he acknowledged, is a matter of faith, and faith is not provable or disprovable through scientific inquiry. Rather, Durkheim tried to understand the role played by religion in social life and the impact on religion of social structure and social change. In short, he treated religion as a social institution.\u21b5\u21b5Sociologists since his time have treated religion in the same way. Anthropologists, historians, and other scholars have also studied religion. The remainder of this chapter reviews what we know about religion as a social institution and the role it plays in American life.\u21b5\u21b5A Brief History of Religion\u21b5\u21b5Every known society has practiced religion, although the nature of religious belief and practice has differed from one society to the next.

They also relied on religion for help in dealing with their daily needs for existence: good weather, a good crop, an abundance of animals to hunt (Noss & Grangaard,\u24232008).Noss, D. S., & Grangaard, B. R. (2008). A history of the world\u2019s religions(12th ed.).

Prominent African American entertainers include former talk show host Oprah Winfrey and the actor Will Smith.\u21b5\u21b5Keep Learning<<\u21b5\u21b5>>The United States'\u242344th president, Barack Obama, is the first African American to hold the office. First elected as a Democratic senator from Illinois, Obama was sworn in as President in January\u24232009, after defeating John McCain.\u21b5\u21b5The first African American Supreme Court Justice was Thurgood Marshall, who joined the Court after being appointed by President Lyndon Johnson in\u24231967. Marshall, a liberal, had successfully argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case before the Court in\u24231952. As a justice, he championed social and civil rights issues. Upon his retirement, in\u24231991, he was replaced by fellow African American Clarence Thomas, a conservative. Thomas was a controversial choice and came under much scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, especially amid allegations of sexual harassment by his former law clerk, Anita Hill. Thomas has not sought the limelight but became known as a conservative judge who favors a strong Executive branch.\u21b5\u21b5Oprah Winfrey is another famous African American. \\\"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\\\" aired from\u24231986 through\u24232011, and was the most popular talk show of its time. Through it, Winfrey became a hugely influential cultural taste maker, and her influence was credited with launching the careers of talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw, interior designer Nate Berkus and many authors through her book club.\u21b5\u21b5African American actor Will Smith is one of Hollywood's top actors. He is widely regarded as one of the top draws in the industry, and has starred in hits such as \\\"Independence Day,\\\" \\\"I Am Legend\\\" and the \\\"Men in Black\\\" franchise of movies.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.062**\\n```\\n\u21b5\u21b5What are the pros and cons of different subscription methods?<< ->> oliakaoil\u21b5\u21b5<<I>> am working on a project that requires site users to maintain a monthly subscription, like Netflix.

You won&#x27;t end up with lots of short-time free users who aren&#x27;t that interested.<p>However, if you make the signup process dead simple (i.e. no payment information required during initial account creation), you pull more users in to the site, get them using the product, and get feedback. Then, your fate is tied to whether or not users actually like your site and service. Also, it&#x27;s an additional step of getting them to enter payment information after they&#x27;ve been enjoying the service for a period of time for free.<p>Anyone with direct experience of these different approaches would be greatly appreciated to contribute their two cents.\u21b5======\u21b5byoung2\u21b5At our startup (we're still stealth, so I don't want to announce it here), we\u21b5found that way more people signed up when we kept the signup as frictionless\u21b5as possible, because our app doesn't sound amazing in the marketing language\u21b5but it really speaks for itself once you start using it (I'm thinking of my\u21b5reaction to the iPhone back in\u24232007 - \\\"so it's like a smartphone without a\u21b5keyboard?

Immunization decision-making for parents is a complex process. Principle health professionals involved in immunization programmes are health visitors, general practitioners, and practice nurses. There is evidence that health visitors and general practitioners influence parental immunization decision-making. However, there is a lack of evidence about the influence of the practice nurse despite their well-documented role in immunization. Integrative literature review. A systematic search of electronic databases, including CINAHL; Medline; PubMed; Google Scholar; ScienceDirect; and Scopus from February\u24231998 - April\u242320<<1>>7. Hand searching and reviewing of secondary references were also undertaken. Two reviewers independently screened records on title and abstract. Studies where the beliefs and perceptions of practice nurses about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine were explored and were published in English were included. The data were analysed using the integrative review processes. Twelve studies were included; these studies were principally descriptive and were of variable methodological quality. Four themes were identified: parental immunization influencing factors, practice nurse characteristics, information and communication, and personal views and concerns. While this review provides an excellent baseline for this information, more recent research conducted in the current policy environment is urgently needed to determine if these views persist. Immunization training and annual updates are essential for practice nurses to keep abreast with the evidence base underpinning national immunization programmes.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.906**\\n```\\nWhat are some poems for an aunt?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>><<:\u21b5\u21b5>>Quick Answer<<\u21b5\u21b5>>A poem for an aunt can highlight the special relationship, as Tayyeba Mustafa does in \\\"My Aunt.\\\" It can tell how she is missed when she's gone, as does Alon Calinao Dy in \\\"My Greatest Aunt.\\\" The poem may pay tribute to her eccentricities, as in Matt Mooney's \\\"Agony Aunt.\\\"\u21b5\u21b5Keep Learning<<\u21b5\u21b5>>In \\\"Aunt,\\\" Al Young creates a vivid portrait of a strong woman who lives her life on her own terms.

In pluralistic medical settings, laypeople choose what to do first, second, third, and fourth from a variety of treatment options. In retrospect, laypeople's choices can be represented as an ordered series of health-related behaviors. A systematic of such sequential data provides insights into caregivers' patterns of resort and suggests a tentative theory for how laypeople make medical choices. This study examines sequences of health-related behaviors from a small, Kom-speaking village in Cameroon. Local residents consider seven health actions, including: delaying initial treatment, using various home remedies or pharmaceuticals, going to a government clinic or a Catholic hospital, and consulting a private nurse or a traditional healer. Researchers visited\u242388 randomly selected compounds on a weekly basis over a\u24235-month period. Data were collected on the treatments associated with\u2423429 nonchronic episodes. Analysis of the treatment sequences suggests that residents customarily use delay of treatments as a tactic in the decision-making process. Caregivers were more likely to use home-based treatments and to use them earlier in the treatment sequences than they were to seek treatment from outside the compound. When seeking assistance, caregivers often used traditional healers as a conduit to other outside options. Laypeople used a limited number of unique treatment sequences and avoided the repetition of treatment modalities. Caregivers act as if they were following three basic tenets. They minimize uncertainty by identifying illness types that require particular health actions and by delaying action. They minimize the cost of care by first resorting to treatments that are less expensive and easier to administer or by reducing the number of treatments tried. And laypeople maximize treatment variety in the hopes of finding at least one treatment that helps stop the illness.\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

Current treatment approaches for type\u24232 diabetes include diet, exercise, and a variety of pharmacologic agents, including insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. In the present scenario, researchers focused themselves on thiazolidine ring-based compounds to cure type\u24232 diabetes mellitus. Among the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, PPAR-\u03b3 is the most effective in curing glucose homeostasis. Thiazolidine ring-based compounds act as PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, and herein, we have successfully developed nine derivatives of thiazolidine ring-based compounds that are found to be biologically potent using two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship model.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.375**\\n```\\n---\u21b5title: Interfaz ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5ms.date:\u242303/30/2017\u21b5api_name:\u21b5- ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5api_location:\u21b5- mscordbi.dll\u21b5api_type:\u21b5- COM\u21b5f1_keywords:\u21b5- ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5helpviewer_keywords:\u21b5- ICorDebugStepper2 interface [.NET Framework debugging]\u21b5ms.assetid:\u24237a191c2a-95ea-4d47-83b0-44de2b632d63\u21b5topic_type:\u21b5- apiref\u21b5ms.openlocfilehash: ef7aa164c43751fa39e49d0ab6486a9f29e23c20\u21b5ms.sourcegitcommit: d6bd7903d7d4669<<8>><<e>>9d89d3725f3bb4876<<8>>91aa3\u21b5ms.translationtype: MT\u21b5ms.contentlocale: es-ES\u21b5ms.lasthandoff:\u242305/13/2020\u21b5ms.locfileid: \\\"83379474\\\"\u21b5---\u21b5# <a name=\\\"icordebugstepper2-interface\\\"></a>Interfaz ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5Proporciona compatibilidad con la depuraci\u00f3n solo mi c\u00f3digo (JMC).  \u21b5  \u21b5## <a name=\\\"methods\\\"></a>M\u00e9todos  \u21b5  \u21b5|M\u00e9todo|Descripci\u00f3n|  \u21b5|------------|-----------------|  \u21b5|[M\u00e9todo SetJMC](icordebugstepper2-setjmc-method.md)|Establece un valor que especifica si esta ICorDebugStepper solo se realiza a trav\u00e9s del c\u00f3digo creado por el desarrollador de una aplicaci\u00f3n.|  \u21b5  \u21b5## <a name=\\\"remarks\\\"></a>Observaciones  \u21b5  \u21b5> [!NOTE]\u21b5> Esta interfaz no admite que se la llame de forma remota, ya sea entre procesos o entre equipos.  \u21b5  \u21b5## <a name=\\\"requirements\\\"></a>Requisitos  \u21b5 **Plataformas:** Vea [Requisitos de sistema](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  \u21b5  \u21b5 **Encabezado:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \u21b5  \u21b5 **Biblioteca:** CorGuids.lib  \u21b5  \u21b5 **.NET Framework versiones:**[!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.375**\\n```\\nDave Clawson\u21b5\u21b5David Paul Clawson (born August\u242316,\u24231967) is an American football coach and former player.\u2423 He currently serves as the head football coach at Wake Forest University.\u2423 Clawson previously served as the head football coach at Fordham University from\u24231999 to\u24232003, at the University of Richmond from\u24232004 to\u24232007, and at Bowling Green State University from\u24232009 to\u24232013.\u21b5\u21b5<<Assistant>> coaching career\u21b5Clawson got his start in the coaching business as the quarterbacks and running backs coach at the University at Albany in\u24231989.\u2423 He was an assistant at Albany again in\u24231990, this time coaching the defensive secondary.\u2423 He later went on to coach as an assistant at the University at Buffalo, Lehigh University, and Villanova University.\u21b5\u21b5Tennessee\u21b5On January\u242311,\u24232008, it was announced that Clawson had been hired as the new offensive coordinator for the Tennessee Volunteers football team by head coach Phillip Fulmer.

While stories contain entities (characters, places) and behaviors (actions), this feature seems to be responding to the higher-level semantic concept of \\\"narrative structure\\\" itself.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects narrative and storytelling patterns, activating on text that contains story elements like character actions, plot progression, and descriptive narrative sequences.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":12.219515800476074,\"api_duration\":12.219501733779907,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":8457,\"output_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "295b6da87c99abdc6a7a55f56cd09776c51dd98a": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":0.6,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":8000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are an AI researcher analyzing a feature from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on a language model.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, I notice a strong pattern of copyright notices and licensing information across multiple examples. The highest-scoring examples include:\\n\\n1. Example 1 (Chat) - Contains corrupted/repeated Chinese characters but starts with what appears to be a copyright-related context\\n2. Examples 3-8 (Chat) - All contain explicit copyright notices with \\\"(c)\\\" symbols and years\\n3. Examples 3-8 (Pretraining) - All contain detailed copyright notices, often with full license text\\n\\nThe feature appears to activate most strongly on:\\n- Copyright symbols and notices: \\\"Copyright (c)\\\", \\\"\u00a9\\\"\\n- Year indicators in copyright contexts: \\\"2023\\\", \\\"2021\\\", \\\"2019\\\", etc.\\n- License-related text: \\\"All rights reserved\\\", \\\"GNU General Public License\\\", \\\"MIT License\\\", \\\"BSD-3-Clause\\\"\\n- Legal boilerplate: \\\"THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS'\\\", \\\"WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND\\\"\\n\\nThe tokens that are highlighted with double angle brackets often include:\\n- \\\"(c)\\\" or \\\"\u00a9\\\" symbols\\n- Years following copyright notices\\n- Words like \\\"Copyright\\\", \\\"rights\\\", \\\"license\\\"\\n\\nThis is clearly a semantic feature rather than an entity or behavior feature. It's not detecting specific entities (like companies or people), nor is it detecting actions or behaviors. Instead, it's detecting an abstract legal/conceptual pattern - the presence of copyright and licensing information in text.
