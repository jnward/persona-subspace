With `CCachedDataPathProperty` objects, you are able to transfer data asynchronously from a URL or file source and store it in a memory file via the `m_Cache` public variable. All the data is stored in the memory file, and there is no need to override [OnDataAvailable](../../mfc/reference/casyncmonikerfile-class.md#ondataavailable) unless you want to watch for notifications and respond. For example, if you are transferring a large.GIF file and want to notify your control that more data has arrived and it should redraw itself, override `OnDataAvailable` to make the notification.\u21b5\u21b5The class `CCachedDataPathProperty` is derived from `CDataPathProperty`.\u21b5\u21b5For more information about how to use asynchronous monikers and ActiveX controls in Internet applications, see the following topics:\u21b5\u21b5- [Internet First\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.312**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>/*\u21b5 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\u21b5 * modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\u21b5 * as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version\u24232\u21b5 * of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\u21b5 *\u21b5 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\u21b5 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\u21b5 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\u2423 See the\u21b5 * GNU General Public License for more details.\u21b5 *\u21b5 * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\u21b5 * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,\u21b5 * Inc.,\u242351 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\u242302110-1301, USA.\u21b5 */\u21b5\u21b5/** \\\\\\\\file\u21b5 * \\\\\\\\ingroup freestyle\u21b5 */\u21b5\u21b5#include \\\"BPy_BBox.h\\\"\u21b5\u21b5#ifdef __cplusplus\u21b5extern \\\"C\\\" {\u21b5#endif\u21b5\u21b5///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\u21b5\u21b5//-------------------MODULE INITIALIZATION--------------------------------\u21b5int BBox_Init(PyObject *module)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 if (module == NULL) {\u21b5    return -1;\u21b5\u2423 }\u21b5\u21b5\u2423 if (PyType_Ready(&BBox_Type) <\u24230) {\u21b5    return -1;\u21b5\u2423 }\u21b5\u2423 Py_INCREF(&BBox_Type);\u21b5\u2423 PyModule_AddObject(module, \\\"BBox\\\", (PyObject *)&BBox_Type);\u21b5\u21b5\u2423 return\u24230;\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5//------------------------INSTANCE METHODS ----------------------------------\u21b5\u21b5PyDoc_STRVAR(BBox_doc,\u21b5            << \\\">>Class for representing a bounding box.\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\".. method:: __init__()\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\"\u21b5             \\\"   Default constructor.\\\");\u21b5\u21b5static int BBox_init(BPy_BBox *self, PyObject *args, PyObject *kwds)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 static const char *kwlist[] = {NULL};\u21b5\u21b5\u2423 if (!PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords(args, kwds, \\\"\\\", (char **)kwlist)) {\u21b5    return -1;\u21b5\u2423 }\u21b5\u2423 self->bb = new BBox<Vec3r>();\u21b5\u2423 return\u24230;\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5static void BBox_dealloc(BPy_BBox *self)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 delete self->bb;\u21b5\u2423 Py_TYPE(self)->tp_free((PyObject *)self);\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5static PyObject *BBox_repr(BPy_BBox *self)\u21b5{\u21b5\u2423 return PyUnicode_FromFormat(\\\"BBox - address: %p\\\", self->bb);\u21b5}\u21b5\u21b5/*-----------------------BPy_BBox type definition ------------------------------*/\u21b5\u21b5PyTypeObject BBox_Type = {\u21b5    PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(NULL,\u24230)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.312**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Apollo Launch Control\u21b5\u21b5September\u242327,\u24232011\u21b5\u21b5I came across the image in this post on my computer and while it\u2019s not a great photograph, I like it.

However, if we were to compare the overall strength and influence of these two nations, the USA would likely have the advantage. The United States is a global superpower and a dominant player in the world stage, with significant military, economic, and cultural influence. Furthermore, the USA is a democratic country with a strong system of government, which may give it an edge in diplomatic negotiations and international relations. However, China is also a rapidly developing country with significant economic and military clout. It is the world's largest exporter and the second-largest economy, with a population of over\u24231.4 billion people. It also possesses a powerful military and a large standing army.

ESAPI provides a set of J2EE interfaces that can be used to perform security checks on web applications.\u21b5\u21b5Here is an example of how you might use ESAPI to check the authenticity of a user:\u21b5\u21b5\u21b5```import org.esapi.EsaApi;\u21b5import org.esapi.authentication.AuthenticationManager;\u21b5import org.esapi.context.Context;\u21b5import org.esapi.context.UserContext;\u21b5import org.esapi.util.SecurityUtil;\u21b5\u21b5//...\u21b5\u21b5// Authenticate the user\u21b5AuthenticationManager.authenticate(UserContext.getUser());\u21b5\u21b5// Check the authenticity of the user\u21b5SecurityUtil.checkAuthenticity(Context.getContext().getUser(), UserContext.getUser());\u21b5```\u21b5\u21b5In this example, the `` AuthenticationManager.authenticate `` method is used to authenticate the user. Once the user is authenticated, the `` SecurityUtil.checkAuthenticity `` method is used to check the authenticity of the user.\u21b5\u21b5The `` checkAuthenticity `` method takes two arguments: the `` User `` object, which represents the authenticated user, and the `` Context `` object, which represents the current context of the application. The `` checkAuthenticity `` method checks whether the user is authorized to access the resource being requested. If the user is not authorized, an error will be thrown. If the user is authorized, the method will return `` true ``.\u21b5\u21b5ESAPI provides a wide range of security checks that can be performed on web applications, including checks for input validation, input encoding, output encoding, and more.

Some of the reasons why C++ may be hard to learn include:\u21b5\u21b51. C++ has a steep learning curve: C++ has a reputation for being a difficult language to learn, especially for those who are new to programming. The language has a lot of complex features and a large number of libraries and frameworks that can be difficult to understand.\u21b52. C++ has a lot of syntax: C++ has a rich set of features and a complex syntax, which can be overwhelming for beginners. The language has a lot of keywords, operators, and other syntax elements that must be memorized and understood in order to write effective C++ code.\u21b53. C++ has a strong focus on performance: C++ is a low-level language that provides a high degree of control over hardware resources. This means that C++ programs can be very fast, but it also means that the programmer must be careful to write efficient code in order to avoid performance issues.\u21b54. C++ has a large ecosystem: C++ has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources available for learning the language. However, this also means that there are many different libraries, frameworks, and tools that can be difficult to keep track of.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, C++ is a powerful and versatile language that offers a wide range of features and capabilities. However, it can be challenging to learn, especially for those who are new to programming.

It takes a different kind of focus and concentration to play on the road. Sometimes, the schedule plays a part in how teams perform on the road. However, some teams play well on the road. Some people like that there aren't any distractions like friends, family and tickets. So, it becomes an individual thing for teams... how they handle the situations.\u21b5But despite what Seattle has done on the road, they still equaled their record of a year ago and I think they're still playing their best basketball right now.

Each team will be able to protect six players, and Chicago can choose from the players that are left unprotected. Hopefully, they will do their homework on the players that are out there. The sixth, seventh and eighth players from other teams will end up as their core. That said, there are a lot of really good players that come off the bench and could be starters in this league. So I think that they're going to get some experienced players, and I think they're going to get some good kids coming out of the rookie draft as well.

Proper field dressing is an essential first step in<< preventing>> the growth of disease-causing bacteria and preserving the meat from animals harvested in the wild. Field dressing must be done as soon as possible in order to ensure rapid body heat loss and to prevent bacterial growth from the internal organs and body fluids from spreading through the carcass, thus ensuring than the meat stays fit for human consumption and improving the overall quality of the meat.\u21b5Field dressing is generally carried out with conventional single blade hunting or skinning knives. A conventional knife may be used to make an incision by the point of the knife blade through the skin and the abdominal wall of the carcass, and then the skin of the animal may be cut away by the blade. Great care must be taken so as not to puncture the intestines or the stomach of the animal with the point of the knife since this would spoil the meat and the hide of the animal. One technique commonly used by hunters is to grasp a conventional knife with the blade facing upwards to avoid cutting the intestines and the entrails. Another commonly used technique is to insert two fingers (one on each side of the knife blade) into the incision, pushing the intestines and the entrails down and away from the knife.\u21b5Conventional knives are generally not well suited for field dressing operations because the tip of a conventional knife blade is pointed. With a pointed-end blade configuration, the occurrence of undesirable cutting or perforation of meat or internal organs is highly probable, since it is very difficult to tightly control the depth of the penetration of a conventional knife blade so as to avoid such cutting or perforation. If the hunter is an experienced field dresser, he or she may make only a few small nicks in the carcass. If he or she is a novice, attempting to field dress an animal with a conventional knife may result in significant damage to the meat and a potential loss of the entire carcass.\u21b5Other tools available to hunters for field dressing include single blade knives with a gut hook built in into the back of the blade, such as, for example, a disposable skinning knife \u201cGerber E-Z Zip Gut Hook Blade\u201d from Gerber. However, these knives are usually too small to field dress large game and are very difficult to sharpen. The \u201cGerber E-Z Zip Gut Hook Blade\u201d knife has a small handle which is awkward to use and is easily breakable.\u21b5It would therefore be a significant advance in the art to provide\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.445**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5Add custom url for my web service in wordpress\u21b5\u21b5I am new in wordpress and i am creating an extension for wordpress.\u2423 I searched a-lot but didn't find any solution.

Create a budget: Identify all your sources of income and expenses, and see where you can cut back on expenses to free up more money to pay off your debt.\u21b52. Prioritize your debt: Make a list of all your debts, and prioritize which ones to pay off first based on the interest rate and the amount owed.\u21b53. Consolidate your debt: Consider consolidating your debt into one loan with a lower interest rate to make it easier to manage and pay off.\u21b54. Negotiate with creditors: If you're having trouble paying your bills, reach out to your creditors to see if they can offer any assistance, such as temporary payment deferment or a reduced payment plan.\u21b55. Avoid taking on more debt: While it may be tempting to take on more debt to try and solve your financial problems, this is usually the wrong approach. Avoid taking on new debt and focus on paying off what you owe.\u21b5\u21b5I hope these tips are helpful my love!

Variation: The first step in the process of natural selection is genetic variation. Every individual in a population has a unique combination of genes, which can result in differences in physical and behavioral traits.\u21b52. Reproduction: Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, producing offspring with a combination of their parent's genes.\u21b53. Environment: The environment in which the organisms live can affect their survival and reproduction. Factors such as climate, food availability, and predators can impact the population.\u21b54. Selection: Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This means that individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to pass on their genes to their offspring.\u21b55. Genetic Drift: From time to time, random events can cause a small number of individuals to migrate to a new area or become isolated from the main population. This can result in the introduction of new genetic variations into a population, or the loss of genetic diversity.\u21b56. Mutation: Mutations are random changes in the DNA of an organism. Some mutations can result in new or beneficial traits, while others can be harmful or have no effect.\u21b5\u21b5Over time, the accumulation of these genetic changes can lead to the evolution of new species or the adaptation of existing species to their environment. This process is known as macroevolution.\u21b5\u21b5Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution, and it plays a critical role in shaping the diversity of life on Earth. By favoring individuals with advantageous traits, natural selection helps to ensure that species are able to adapt to changing environments and survive over time.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>Natural selection is a process by which individuals of a species tend to have babies with similar traits to themselves.

It is one of the main mechanisms of evolution, which is the gradual change of a species over generations<<.\u21b5\u21b5>>The process of natural selection involves several key components:\u21b5\u21b51. Variation: Individuals within a population exhibit genetic variation for a trait, meaning that some individuals have different versions of a gene that codes for a particular trait.\u21b52. Heritability: The trait is heritable, meaning that the variation in the trait is passed down from parents to offspring.\u21b53. Environmental Pressure: The population is exposed to a specific environmental pressure, such as a change in climate, availability of resources, or the presence of predators.\u21b54. Reproductive Success: The environmental pressure favors some individuals over others based on their trait. Individuals with the trait that is better suited to the new environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to their offspring.\u21b55. Genetic Change: Over time, the frequency of the gene for the desired trait increases in the population as it is passed on from generation to generation. This leads to a change in the gene pool of the population, which can result in the evolution of a new species.\u21b5\u21b5Natural selection acts on the variation that exists within a population, favoring individuals with traits that are better suited to their environment. Over time, this leads to the survival and reproduction of individuals with certain traits, and the extinction or decline of individuals with other traits. This process of natural selection results in the adaptation of species to their environment, allowing them to survive and thrive in their ecosystem.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>Natural selection is a process that occurs over time and is the primary mechanism by which populations of organisms change over time. It is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population as a result of the survival and reproduction of individuals with those traits.\u21b5\u21b5The process of natural selection begins with the existence of a variety of traits within a population of organisms. Some of these traits may be beneficial, while others may be neutral or harmful. For example, a population of birds may have a range of beak sizes, some of which may be better suited for eating certain types of food. Some birds may have longer, more slender beaks that are better suited for catching insects and grubs, while others may have shorter, more powerful beaks that are better suited for cracking open nuts and seeds.\u21b5\u21b5The process of natural selection begins when an environmental change occurs that affects the survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits. For example, if there is a change in the availability of different types of food, the birds with longer beaks may have an advantage over those with shorter beaks. This is because the longer beaks are better suited for catching insects and grubs, which become more abundant in the new environment. As a result, the population of birds with longer beaks may increase in size, while the population of birds with shorter beaks may decrease.\u21b5\u21b5Over time, this process can lead to the evolution of new species. For example, if the environmental change persists for many generations, the population of birds with longer beaks may eventually become so large that they become a separate species, while the birds with shorter beaks may remain a separate species. This process is known as speciation.\u21b5\u21b5Natural selection also plays a role in the adaptation of species over time. Traits that are beneficial for survival and reproduction in a particular environment will become more common in the population, while traits that are harmful will become less common. As a result, the species will become better adapted to the environment over time. For example, the evolution of humans from our ancestors has been driven in part by natural selection, with individuals with traits that were beneficial for survival and reproduction in the environment of the time becoming more common.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, the process of natural selection is a powerful mechanism for driving the evolution and adaptation<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>Natural selection is a process that occurs in all organisms in the natural world and is responsible for the evolution and adaptation of species.

These mutations are passed down through generations and are a result of natural selection. They may result in the development of new traits or abilities that are beneficial for the organism's survival or reproduction.\u21b5Species that evolve through natural selection are those that have been selected for their ability to survive and reproduce in the natural world. These species are often characterized by traits such as resistance to disease, adaptation to changing environments, and the ability to adapt to changing factors such as temperature, light, and pressure.\u21b5Natural selection is an important process in evolution because it allows for the rapid and continuous change that occurs in the natural world. It also allows for the evolution of species that are not directly affected by changes in their environment, such as species that live in isolated locations or that are unable to adapt to changes in their environment.\u21b5Overall, natural selection is a fundamental principle in the study of evolution and adaptation, and it plays a critical role in the evolution and survival of species.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 16.000**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5Explain the process of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and discuss its potential applications and ethical implications<<.>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|><<assistant>><<\u21b5>>CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful gene-editing technology that allows for rapid and precise manipulation of genetic material.

(1947). The elementary forms of religious life (J. Swain, Trans.). Glencoe, IL: Free Press. (Original work published\u24231915)observed long ago that every society has beliefs about things that are supernatural and awe-inspiring and beliefs about things that are more practical and down-to-earth. He called the former beliefs sacred beliefs and the latter beliefs profane beliefs. Religious beliefs and practices involve the sacred: they involve things our senses cannot readily observe, and they involve things that inspire in us awe, reverence, and even fear.\u21b5\u21b5Durkheim did not try to prove or disprove religious beliefs. Religion, he acknowledged, is a matter of faith, and faith is not provable or disprovable through scientific inquiry. Rather, Durkheim tried to understand the role played by religion in social life and the impact on religion of social structure and social change. In short, he treated religion as a social institution.\u21b5\u21b5Sociologists since his time have treated religion in the same way. Anthropologists, historians, and other scholars have also studied religion. The remainder of this chapter reviews what we know about religion as a social institution and the role it plays in American life.\u21b5\u21b5A Brief History of Religion\u21b5\u21b5Every known society has practiced religion, although the nature of religious belief and practice has differed from one society to the next.

They also relied on religion for help in dealing with their daily needs for existence: good weather, a good crop, an abundance of animals to hunt (Noss & Grangaard,\u24232008).Noss, D. S., & Grangaard, B. R. (2008). A history of the world\u2019s religions(12th ed.).

Prominent African American entertainers include former talk show host Oprah Winfrey and the actor Will Smith.\u21b5\u21b5Keep Learning<<\u21b5\u21b5>>The United States'\u242344th president, Barack Obama, is the first African American to hold the office. First elected as a Democratic senator from Illinois, Obama was sworn in as President in January\u24232009, after defeating John McCain.\u21b5\u21b5The first African American Supreme Court Justice was Thurgood Marshall, who joined the Court after being appointed by President Lyndon Johnson in\u24231967. Marshall, a liberal, had successfully argued the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case before the Court in\u24231952. As a justice, he championed social and civil rights issues. Upon his retirement, in\u24231991, he was replaced by fellow African American Clarence Thomas, a conservative. Thomas was a controversial choice and came under much scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, especially amid allegations of sexual harassment by his former law clerk, Anita Hill. Thomas has not sought the limelight but became known as a conservative judge who favors a strong Executive branch.\u21b5\u21b5Oprah Winfrey is another famous African American. \\\"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\\\" aired from\u24231986 through\u24232011, and was the most popular talk show of its time. Through it, Winfrey became a hugely influential cultural taste maker, and her influence was credited with launching the careers of talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw, interior designer Nate Berkus and many authors through her book club.\u21b5\u21b5African American actor Will Smith is one of Hollywood's top actors. He is widely regarded as one of the top draws in the industry, and has starred in hits such as \\\"Independence Day,\\\" \\\"I Am Legend\\\" and the \\\"Men in Black\\\" franchise of movies.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.062**\\n```\\n\u21b5\u21b5What are the pros and cons of different subscription methods?<< ->> oliakaoil\u21b5\u21b5<<I>> am working on a project that requires site users to maintain a monthly subscription, like Netflix.

You won&#x27;t end up with lots of short-time free users who aren&#x27;t that interested.<p>However, if you make the signup process dead simple (i.e. no payment information required during initial account creation), you pull more users in to the site, get them using the product, and get feedback. Then, your fate is tied to whether or not users actually like your site and service. Also, it&#x27;s an additional step of getting them to enter payment information after they&#x27;ve been enjoying the service for a period of time for free.<p>Anyone with direct experience of these different approaches would be greatly appreciated to contribute their two cents.\u21b5======\u21b5byoung2\u21b5At our startup (we're still stealth, so I don't want to announce it here), we\u21b5found that way more people signed up when we kept the signup as frictionless\u21b5as possible, because our app doesn't sound amazing in the marketing language\u21b5but it really speaks for itself once you start using it (I'm thinking of my\u21b5reaction to the iPhone back in\u24232007 - \\\"so it's like a smartphone without a\u21b5keyboard?

Immunization decision-making for parents is a complex process. Principle health professionals involved in immunization programmes are health visitors, general practitioners, and practice nurses. There is evidence that health visitors and general practitioners influence parental immunization decision-making. However, there is a lack of evidence about the influence of the practice nurse despite their well-documented role in immunization. Integrative literature review. A systematic search of electronic databases, including CINAHL; Medline; PubMed; Google Scholar; ScienceDirect; and Scopus from February\u24231998 - April\u242320<<1>>7. Hand searching and reviewing of secondary references were also undertaken. Two reviewers independently screened records on title and abstract. Studies where the beliefs and perceptions of practice nurses about the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine were explored and were published in English were included. The data were analysed using the integrative review processes. Twelve studies were included; these studies were principally descriptive and were of variable methodological quality. Four themes were identified: parental immunization influencing factors, practice nurse characteristics, information and communication, and personal views and concerns. While this review provides an excellent baseline for this information, more recent research conducted in the current policy environment is urgently needed to determine if these views persist. Immunization training and annual updates are essential for practice nurses to keep abreast with the evidence base underpinning national immunization programmes.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 4.906**\\n```\\nWhat are some poems for an aunt?\u21b5\u21b5<<A>><<:\u21b5\u21b5>>Quick Answer<<\u21b5\u21b5>>A poem for an aunt can highlight the special relationship, as Tayyeba Mustafa does in \\\"My Aunt.\\\" It can tell how she is missed when she's gone, as does Alon Calinao Dy in \\\"My Greatest Aunt.\\\" The poem may pay tribute to her eccentricities, as in Matt Mooney's \\\"Agony Aunt.\\\"\u21b5\u21b5Keep Learning<<\u21b5\u21b5>>In \\\"Aunt,\\\" Al Young creates a vivid portrait of a strong woman who lives her life on her own terms.

In pluralistic medical settings, laypeople choose what to do first, second, third, and fourth from a variety of treatment options. In retrospect, laypeople's choices can be represented as an ordered series of health-related behaviors. A systematic of such sequential data provides insights into caregivers' patterns of resort and suggests a tentative theory for how laypeople make medical choices. This study examines sequences of health-related behaviors from a small, Kom-speaking village in Cameroon. Local residents consider seven health actions, including: delaying initial treatment, using various home remedies or pharmaceuticals, going to a government clinic or a Catholic hospital, and consulting a private nurse or a traditional healer. Researchers visited\u242388 randomly selected compounds on a weekly basis over a\u24235-month period. Data were collected on the treatments associated with\u2423429 nonchronic episodes. Analysis of the treatment sequences suggests that residents customarily use delay of treatments as a tactic in the decision-making process. Caregivers were more likely to use home-based treatments and to use them earlier in the treatment sequences than they were to seek treatment from outside the compound. When seeking assistance, caregivers often used traditional healers as a conduit to other outside options. Laypeople used a limited number of unique treatment sequences and avoided the repetition of treatment modalities. Caregivers act as if they were following three basic tenets. They minimize uncertainty by identifying illness types that require particular health actions and by delaying action. They minimize the cost of care by first resorting to treatments that are less expensive and easier to administer or by reducing the number of treatments tried. And laypeople maximize treatment variety in the hopes of finding at least one treatment that helps stop the illness.\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?

Current treatment approaches for type\u24232 diabetes include diet, exercise, and a variety of pharmacologic agents, including insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. In the present scenario, researchers focused themselves on thiazolidine ring-based compounds to cure type\u24232 diabetes mellitus. Among the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, PPAR-\u03b3 is the most effective in curing glucose homeostasis. Thiazolidine ring-based compounds act as PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, and herein, we have successfully developed nine derivatives of thiazolidine ring-based compounds that are found to be biologically potent using two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship model.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.375**\\n```\\n---\u21b5title: Interfaz ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5ms.date:\u242303/30/2017\u21b5api_name:\u21b5- ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5api_location:\u21b5- mscordbi.dll\u21b5api_type:\u21b5- COM\u21b5f1_keywords:\u21b5- ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5helpviewer_keywords:\u21b5- ICorDebugStepper2 interface [.NET Framework debugging]\u21b5ms.assetid:\u24237a191c2a-95ea-4d47-83b0-44de2b632d63\u21b5topic_type:\u21b5- apiref\u21b5ms.openlocfilehash: ef7aa164c43751fa39e49d0ab6486a9f29e23c20\u21b5ms.sourcegitcommit: d6bd7903d7d4669<<8>><<e>>9d89d3725f3bb4876<<8>>91aa3\u21b5ms.translationtype: MT\u21b5ms.contentlocale: es-ES\u21b5ms.lasthandoff:\u242305/13/2020\u21b5ms.locfileid: \\\"83379474\\\"\u21b5---\u21b5# <a name=\\\"icordebugstepper2-interface\\\"></a>Interfaz ICorDebugStepper2\u21b5Proporciona compatibilidad con la depuraci\u00f3n solo mi c\u00f3digo (JMC).  \u21b5  \u21b5## <a name=\\\"methods\\\"></a>M\u00e9todos  \u21b5  \u21b5|M\u00e9todo|Descripci\u00f3n|  \u21b5|------------|-----------------|  \u21b5|[M\u00e9todo SetJMC](icordebugstepper2-setjmc-method.md)|Establece un valor que especifica si esta ICorDebugStepper solo se realiza a trav\u00e9s del c\u00f3digo creado por el desarrollador de una aplicaci\u00f3n.|  \u21b5  \u21b5## <a name=\\\"remarks\\\"></a>Observaciones  \u21b5  \u21b5> [!NOTE]\u21b5> Esta interfaz no admite que se la llame de forma remota, ya sea entre procesos o entre equipos.  \u21b5  \u21b5## <a name=\\\"requirements\\\"></a>Requisitos  \u21b5 **Plataformas:** Vea [Requisitos de sistema](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).  \u21b5  \u21b5 **Encabezado:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \u21b5  \u21b5 **Biblioteca:** CorGuids.lib  \u21b5  \u21b5 **.NET Framework versiones:**[!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.375**\\n```\\nDave Clawson\u21b5\u21b5David Paul Clawson (born August\u242316,\u24231967) is an American football coach and former player.\u2423 He currently serves as the head football coach at Wake Forest University.\u2423 Clawson previously served as the head football coach at Fordham University from\u24231999 to\u24232003, at the University of Richmond from\u24232004 to\u24232007, and at Bowling Green State University from\u24232009 to\u24232013.\u21b5\u21b5<<Assistant>> coaching career\u21b5Clawson got his start in the coaching business as the quarterbacks and running backs coach at the University at Albany in\u24231989.\u2423 He was an assistant at Albany again in\u24231990, this time coaching the defensive secondary.\u2423 He later went on to coach as an assistant at the University at Buffalo, Lehigh University, and Villanova University.\u21b5\u21b5Tennessee\u21b5On January\u242311,\u24232008, it was announced that Clawson had been hired as the new offensive coordinator for the Tennessee Volunteers football team by head coach Phillip Fulmer.

While stories contain entities (characters, places) and behaviors (actions), this feature seems to be responding to the higher-level semantic concept of \\\"narrative structure\\\" itself.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects narrative and storytelling patterns, activating on text that contains story elements like character actions, plot progression, and descriptive narrative sequences.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":12.219515800476074,\"api_duration\":12.219501733779907,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":8457,\"output_tokens\":278,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}", "295b6da87c99abdc6a7a55f56cd09776c51dd98a": "{\"params\":{\"model\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"n\":1,\"num_candidates_per_completion\":1,\"insufficient_valids_behaviour\":\"retry\",\"temperature\":0.6,\"top_p\":null,\"max_tokens\":8000,\"thinking\":null,\"logprobs\":null,\"seed\":null,\"logit_bias\":null,\"stop\":null,\"unknown_kwargs\":{}},\"prompt\":{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"You are an AI researcher analyzing a feature from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on a language model.

Where were you born and raised? Education? Where are you living now? Anything else you want to share.\u21b5\u21b5Michael Luis Medrano<<:>> I was born and raised in Fresno, California where I attended Duncan Polytechnical High School and California State University, Fresno. I received an MFA (Master of Fine Arts) in creative writing from the University of Minnesota in\u24232006. I moved back to Fresno in\u24232008 after spending five years living in Minneapolis and San Diego.\u21b5\u21b5Rojas: How did you get into writing? Do you just do poetry?\u21b5\u21b5Medrano: My formal introduction into poetry and Chicano literature was in the late poet, Andres Montoya\u2019s lit class at Fresno City College. There, I was introduced to many Fresno poets, including Omar Salinas, Jose Montoya, and Lorna Dee Cervantes. Their works, especially Salinas\u2019s Fresno poems were fresh and inspiring introductions to Chicano poetry. I also started attending writing workshops led by Margarita Luna Robles and Juan Felipe Herrera around\u24231998. All three teachers are/were very innovative in their pedagogy. I value their influence til\u2019 this day.\u21b5\u21b5I was introduced to the prose poem by Ray Gonz\u00e1lez in Minnesota and have been writing those lyrical paragraphs since\u24232003. But trying new forms is not at all foreign to me. JFH encouraged playwriting along w/ verse. I\u2019ve tried acting and improvisation also and feel that poems can take various shapes and forms.\u21b5\u21b5Medrano: The book\u2019s shape (concept, narrative arc, etc.) was developed in the creative writing program. Most of the poems that were written after poets, for particular individuals, poems about death, and the more daring surreal poems were written in the program. The poems that sound more performance driven (\u201cThe Cholo of Yesteryear,\u201d \u201cListening to Bukowski,\u201d and a few others) were mostly written in Fresno where I honed my poetry chops at venues like Juan Felipe Herrera\u2019s Manikrudo performance ensembles and the Central Chakrah experiments with Tim Z Hern\u00e1ndez and Estela Molina, among others.\u21b5\u21b5After the manuscript was completed in May\u24232006, I printed out at least\u242320 copies of the manuscript in the graduate students computer lab at the University of Minnesota. I\u2019m pretty sure I wasn\u2019t the only grad student\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.621**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>\u21b5Have you experienced the customer-investor-team conundrum? - juwo\u21b5http://juwo-works.blogspot.com/\u21b5======\u21b5danielha\u21b5It's not easy.

Do they come in and out of our physical density from one of the astral planes?\u21b5\u21b5Ra<<:>> I am Ra. These entities are, shall we say, creatures of the Orion group. They do not exist in astral planes as do the thought-forms but wait within the Earth\u2019s surface. We, as always, remind you that it is our impression that this type of information is unimportant.\u21b5\u21b543.6Questioner: Are you saying, then, that these parts that are removed are related to the mass consciousness of the third-density human form on the planet and this fear is being used in some way by the second-density entities or, correction, the thought-form entities that do the mutilations?\u21b5\u21b5Ra: I am Ra. This is correct as latterly stated. The thought-form entities feed upon fear; thus they are able to do precise damage according to systems of symbology.

The two most usual types of bidding are: One, the use of perversions of sexual magic; two, the use of perversions of ritual magic. In each case the key to success is the purity of the will of the bidder. The concentration upon victory over the servant must be nearly perfect.\u21b5\u21b512.18Questioner: Are there any Confederation or Orion individuals living on Earth visible to us and important in our society at this time?

However, the crusaders of Orion use two types of entities to do their bidding, shall we say.

Going through your biography I noticed that you were born in PA. Just wondering what is in the water there that has brought out so many talented filmmakers in the horror scene?\u21b5\u21b5JTS<< ~>>That\u2019s funny. I\u2019m a huge George Romero fan. The original Dawn of the Dead is my all-time favorite horror film. I love Night of the Living Dead, Creepshow, The Crazies, Day of the Dead\u2026 I can go on and on about George Romero. I was fortunate enough to work with John Russo back in the\u242390s on a film called Santa Claws. John co-wrote and co-produced the original Night of the Living Dead. I produced Santa Claws and John wrote and directed it. We had a bunch of the cast from Night of the Living Dead in the film\u2026 It was very cool working with them after being a fan for so many years.\u21b5\u21b5Splat ~ Found footage has certainly found its niche within the horror genre! What brought you to that thought process that said I want to create a found footage film from the perspective of brothers going through their business of sorts with your upcoming feature Infliction?\u21b5\u21b5JTS ~It wasn\u2019t so much that I wanted to create a found footage film\u2026 The story dictated it. In other words, the cameras in Infliction serve a purpose that ties in with the brothers\u2019 actions\u2026 There\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re documenting everything. Infliction is basically an artistic, character-driven found footage film\u2026 It\u2019s dark and disturbing\u2026 And brutal. But as you watch the film, you\u2019ll find yourself asking\u2026 Who are the true criminals here and who are the true victims?\u21b5\u21b5Splat ~ Within the framework of the trailer for Infliction I got the impression this is why more than just another found footage vehicle. That there is more to these guys filming their deeds than just for the sake of thrills or what have you. Can you go into this a little?\u21b5\u21b5JTS ~You\u2019re absolutely right! This is NOT a thrill kill. There\u2019s a reason why the brothers target the people that they do\u2026 And as Infliction plays out you find out the truth behind their actions\u2026 I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s more disturbing\u2026 The brutality of their actions\u2026 Or the truth behind it.\u21b5\u21b5Splat ~ What other plans do you have as a filmmaker for the near future?

Senior counter-terrorism sources confirmed the threat from dissidents attacking the mainland \\\"now goes beyond an aspiration\\\" and that they now possess the means to mount an attack across the Irish Sea.\u21b5\u21b5Amid rising tension in the province and fears of an \\\"Easter offensive\\\" by dissident groups, police in Northern Ireland also warned that anti-ceasefire republicans were plotting to kill more police officers.\u21b5\u21b5The increased threat from republican dissidents is certain to heighten security concerns during the build-up to the royal wedding on Friday, although there is no intelligence suggesting a specific plot related to the event.\u21b5\u21b5On Friday another dissident grouping, styling itself \\\"the IRA\\\", issued a public statement claiming responsibility for the murder of PC Ronan Kerr in Omagh this month. The group, comprising former members of the Provisional IRA, vowed to embark on a bombing campaign. It is understood that the new group includes veteran paramilitaries who were involved in transporting and later detonating the bomb that exploded at London's Canary Wharf in\u24231996.\u21b5\u21b5Intelligence officials monitoring dissident activity point to a growing sophistication in bomb-making techniques and a widening range of attack techniques as evidence of expanding capability. A senior intelligence source told the Observer: \\\"We feel there is capability to attempt some form of an attack on Britain. Based on our assessment, it goes beyond an aspiration.\\\" Dissident groups have recently deployed command-wire explosive devices, van-mounted weaponry, car bombs and vehicle booby traps, as well as more orthodox military equipment such as hand-grenades. Several individuals are believed to be under surveillance.\u21b5\u21b5The mainland has not experienced an Irish republican attack since car bombs exploded at the BBC Television Centre and Ealing Broadway station in London in\u24232001. The head of MI5, Jonathan Evans, said last September, however, that dissidents posed a \\\"real and increasing security challenge in Northern Ireland\\\" and could be planning attacks elsewhere. According to MI5's Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, the official threat level is \\\"substantial\\\", meaning an attack is a \\\"strong possibility\\\".\u21b5\u21b5On Saturday a man appeared in court facing charges in connection with the murder of Kerr. Gavin Coyle,\u242333, from Omagh was charged with possession of explosives, firearms and articles likely to be of use to terrorists. He was remanded in custody.

Nesse livro, o autor afirma que todas as palavras s\u00e3o compostas por duas met\u00e1foras: A primeira \u00e9 quando olhamos para um objeto ou ser e transformamos essa coisa em uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o (imagem) em nossas mentes, a segunda seria quando transformamos essa imagem em uma palavra. Portanto, se algo surge a partir de duas met\u00e1foras, nunca pode traduzir o sentido real que deseja expressar. Seguindo nessa linha, penso que as vezes, mesmo em outras l\u00ednguas, n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel explicar algo que surge em nossa mente ou algum sentimento atrav\u00e9s de palavras, sei que existem outros meios de transmiss\u00e3o como a dan\u00e7a e movimentos corporais, mas sinto que acaba se tornando algo subjetivo, talvez semelhantemente \u00e0s palavras.\u21b5\u21b5Nesse sentido, o que voc\u00eas pensam sobre as palavras?

I.E. \u201cSEO Kansas City\u201d\u21b5\u21b5Keyword research should have a heavy focus on the amount of traffic each term is receiving. You don\u2019t want to target terms that get little to no search volume. Target terms that get very high search volume and in turn, you\u2019ll get more traffic to your website. This part of the research can sometimes get frustrating for a business owner, especially the more complicated your business. Business owners want to be recognized for their professionalism and want the technical terms to be used correctly. In reality, people use the simplest terms to search online. The key here is to not be offended if the highest volume term isn\u2019t the correct term for your industry. Just use it and move along or your traffic will suffer.\u21b5\u21b5Brainstorm simple keywords for your industry. Things like \u201cHow to Rank in Google\u201d or \u201cHow to do SEO\u201d would be great for our marketing industry!\u21b5\u21b5Use a keyword research tool to help you.

Sony had made smartphones before. It had also made gaming consoles and handheld entertainment devices. What no one had done was marry an entertainment system into a cutting edge smartphone. The market potential was huge, and Sony knew it. Not only did Sony release the Xperia Play, it also introduced the PlayStation Certified program which would let other manufacturers build devices worthy of the PlayStation name and enable them to play PlayStation Mobile games.\u21b5\u21b5Unfortunately the PlayStation Certified program didn\u2019t take off. Developers didn\u2019t need a Sony sticker to make games successful, they ended up being able to do that all on their own. However, we were still left with smartphones and tablets running games, which although convenient, didn\u2019t lend themselves to comfortable game play.\u21b5\u21b5Lets shift gears for a moment.\u21b5\u21b5NVIDIA makes great hardware. I\u2019ve personally used its video cards and even motherboards using chipsets from the company for years. Even the computer that I<<\u2019m>><< using>><< to>><< write>><< this>> article is powered by an NVIDIA GeForce GTX\u2423650 Ti video card. NVIDIA is also makes SoCs that power some of today\u2019s more notable smartphones and tablets. With all that power and gaming experience, it should come as no surprise that NVIDIA would eventually come out with something game-related in the mobile space. Not long ago it introduced us to the NVIDIA Shield, a portable gaming system powered by Android\u24234.2 Jelly Bean.\u21b5\u21b5The concept is brilliant. NVIDIA was able to bootstrap a portable gaming system to market by leveraging its experience with SoCs, build upon the Android operating system and Google Play Services, and take advantage of the games that are already available from the Play Store. Additionally, NVIDIA is bringing PC gaming to its portable device though some interesting technology and a PC game streaming service.\u21b5\u21b5Sony, however, is nowhere to be found. It already has a presence in Android-powered smartphones. It already has an insanely popular console, complete with online components for interactive game play. All Sony is missing is a current version of the Xperia Play which lets us play our PlayStation games and connect to the PlayStation Network.\u21b5\u21b5With Android rising in popularity, Android games starting to rival PC and console titles, and mobile networks finally at a point where speed and latency aren\u2019t an issue, Sony could score a major win by releasing a new Xperia Play and bring mobile gaming and portable entertainment to a whole new level.\u21b5\u21b5Joe graduated from Weber\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 22.875**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5get rid of character from jsfiddle\u21b5\u21b5jsFiddle seems to put a character in the fiddles that is invisible and causes erros when javascript is copy/pasted into another editor and run.

Mom's told me stories since I can remember my mom talking to me of the jewelry she had when she was young. We're poor -- but mom didn't grow up poor. Even as a young child she had expensive trinkets. She also had people who worked around the house for her parents -- maids and such. One of them was a young girl who stole some of my moms most precious pieces. She's told me about the gorgeous blue star sapphire that was stolen for years -- I swear, she's still really bitter about it.

It isn\u2019t something that is given to us by any guru, or something only understood by the elite. Medicine, true medicine, is wild abundant and free.\u21b5\u21b5If you asked indigenous people around the world what they considered to be medicine, you would get many different answers. Plants, stones, stars, words, chants, water. But you would see one commonality \u2013 many things are medicine, and everything is medicine. Medicine, by definition, is something that helps us heal. Fresh picked strawberries, first kisses, kitten purrs and a thick night of stars. All of this affects us deeply, our inner hearts, our sense of well-being. Opening new layers of meaning, comfort, security, belonging, profundity, inspiration and expression. All of this is medicine.\u21b5\u21b5Since I posted to my video, Stone Medicine Grounded, to Facebook a few weeks ago it has gotten more views than anything I\u2019ve ever released.

Resource optimization: Strategy allows organizations to optimize their use of limited resources, such as capital, human resources, and time. By carefully considering how resources should be allocated, organizations can ensure they are investing in the most valuable projects and initiatives.\u21b57. Focus on goals: Strategy provides a clear focus on the organization's goals and objectives. This can help to motivate and inspire employees, as well as facilitate communication and collaboration across the organization.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, strategy is important because it helps organizations achieve their goals, maintain a competitive advantage, manage risks, and adapt to changing circumstances.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n### Pretraining Examples  \\n**Example 1 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 7.781**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5Why and how the masses attract each other?\u21b5\u21b5We generally say that the gravitational force acts between the two bodies of some masses. Why and how that force is generated? What is the main mechanism behind this force?\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Why and how that force is generated? What is the main mechanism behind this force?\u21b5\u21b5Physics does not answer ultimate \\\"why\\\" questions<<,>> because it is a discipline which ultimately describes with mathematical models what is observed in nature. The models differ from maps because they not only fit existing data/measurements but are also predictive of new results of experiments and observations. Then the model can be used to see how from one state another state can be predicted or described. The why is contained into the laws and postulates of the theoretical model, which are a distillation of observations/measurements or necessary to identify the mathematical functions with physical measurements .\u21b5In gravitation the first successful predictive model was Newton's gravitational model:\u21b5\u21b5Newton's law of universal gravitation states that a \u21b5\u2423 particle attracts every other particle in the universe using a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres. This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called inductive reasoning.\u21b5\u21b5Together with the laws of classical mechanics the behavior of masses could be explained , i.e. once the laws are assumed the how could be shown mathematically and the outcome calculated.\u21b5Once the microcosm started being explored classical mechanics became inadequate to describe and predict behaviors. Quantum mechanics and special relativity were necessary to describe mathematically and predict results. \u21b5The study of the heavenly sphere by astronomy and later astrophysicists showed that Newtonian gravitational theory was inadequate and General Relativity was proposed for large masses with new laws, but still the existence of mass is an observational fact included in a nested fashion\u2423 in the postulates of general relativity.:\u21b5\u21b5The first postulate is the relativity principle: local physics is governed by the theory of special relativity. The second postulate is the equivalence principle: there is no way for an observer to distinguish locally between gravity and acceleration.\u21b5\u21b5The measured mass\u2423 concept is nested in the first postulate, as shown in the link.\u21b5So the answer to your question of \\\"why\\\" , is because that is what measurements and observations say. The \\\"how\\\" is given by the corresponding mathematical theory of Newtonian gravity or General relativity depending on the dimensions and other boundary conditions of the problem under study.\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 6.562**\\n```\\nName the last thing you bought and when?

There will be limited free content but no more unlimited access.\u21b5\u21b5I am confident that some very smart and well-informed business people have looked at this, studied it and after due consideration chosen this path. It is, of course (to follow the metaphor) a path that leads to a wall. In other words, it\u2019s a dead end.\u21b5\u21b5I believe this is exactly the wrong strategy and is doomed to failure. It is not that clich\u00e9 that \u201cinformation wants to be free on the internet.\u201d Information doesn\u2019t \u201cwant\u201d anything<<.>> The problem is that information is free on the internet and is likely to remain so.\u21b5\u21b5If you want to know what political folly is going on, it\u2019s all over \u201cfree media:\u201d TV, cable and the net. If you want sport scores or reports, ditto. A newspaper is no longer a delivery system for news. It is more and more about views, opinions and relationships. Most newspapers and their web sites have little that can be held hostage behind a pay wall.\u21b5\u21b5In fact, I believe the strategists have it backwards. Instead of restricting visits, news web sites should be out promoting views. The trick is to get the click and drive traffic up. Ah, you ask, but where is the money? Good question. Just remember that newspapers were seldom made profitable by subscriptions. They were advertising vehicles. When the classifieds moved to the net, profits nose-dived. The industry response was to fire writers and editors and slim down the product. This has led to a death spiral. Fewer pages, fewer customers and much less revenue from advertising.\u21b5\u21b5As advertising moved to the web, the news business had to follow. Now online revenue from advertising makes some money but next to nothing compared with the good old days of a decade ago. But the good old days are not coming back. We won\u2019t see\u242347 billion bucks in print ads, and the\u24232 billion that now comes in from online won\u2019t keep us in business.\u21b5\u21b5Advertising can only increase on the net if more, not fewer, views come to us. Advertisers will not spend more money to reach fewer eyes. We should be promoting viewers and not driving them away. We should be establishing our sites as brands. The model is Huffington Post.

After\u242345 years of marriage to the same woman, the sex has fallen off to zero. We otherwise have a great and comfortable relationship. If I want any at all these days, the only options are masturbation or professional service providers. I was very nervous the first time I paid for sex. Curiously and surprisingly, considering my Christian upbringing, I didn't feel at all guilty. I now find the urge gets stronger as the body gets weaker. It seems as geezerdom takes a full hold, all I think about is pussy, and paid sex has become a regular thing. You stress honesty and communication for a long-term relationship to work. In our case, honesty would mean the end to what is now just a great friendship that provides us both with deeply satisfying companionship. I don't want to hurt her, but revealing my outside activities would certainly do so, as she thinks men using prostitutes is disgusting.

I clicked it but its very annoying, how do i remove this feature so that if i use snipping tool it doesn't automatically open snag it editor?\u21b5\u21b5Yes, thanks. Annoying that it does this by default. Even more annoying that the option to turn it off is pretty much \\\"hidden\\\". I was looking in the Snipping Tool preferences and in the Snagit Editor options. Who would have thought that the option in the Snagit Capture prefs controls ALL screenshots.\u21b5\u21b5So I have the opposite request. The (Win+Shift+S) shortcut is far more efficient than Snagit's capture button. Is there a way to have that snipping tool open up snagit only, instead of opening the windows snipping tool editor AND snagit?\u21b5\u21b5You should be able to alter the global hotkey for the capture (shown below), but you may not need too. The \\\"Print Screen\\\" key activates a SnagIt Capture the same way Win+Shift+S would in this scenario.\u21b5\u21b5You may need to disable the Snipping Tool however to avoid a conflict, not sure.\u21b5\u21b5Hey Shaw, unfortunately we're just users like yourself so we can't offer comprehensive tech-support<<,>> you might want to reach out to TechSmith Support.

I have now disabled the integration (as above) and deselected Capture Preferences -> Capture -> \\\"Open screenshots copied from system tools\\\" and that seems to have done the trick. I have the General-> \\\"Capture Window & OneClick\\\" selected, so I have the little drop down capture button for when I want to change the capture settings, plus the short cut on Printscreen, so I'm happy with that. :)\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.562**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5Which IDE does Google use for C++ and Java development\u21b5\u21b5I am curious which IDE does Google use for C++ and Java development?\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Google is not a single person<<.>> Probably lots of IDEs and tools are used there.\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Developers in Google are allowed to pick whatever IDE they feel most comfortable in.\u2423 They are even allowed to pick which OS they feel most comfortable in.\u2423 So it ranges from anything from Vi to Emacs to NetBeans to Eclipse to Visual Studio.\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Mehrdad is very correct that it is highly unlikely that they standardize on one IDE for each language.

Or will the USB battery pack just not output\u24232.4\\\\xa0A and split the power in some different arrangement? \u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Power supplies don't \\\"split\\\" anything<<,>> they just maintain their output voltage, and can supply current up to their specified maximum power capability, whatever it is. The loads are connected in parallel, and each load will take whatever current it needs. \u21b5If you have a\u24235-V supply with\u24232.4 A rating, the fan will take\u24230.35 A, not more. Fan's rating of\u24235V@0.35 A means that the fan has resistance of about\u242314 Ohms. The\u242314-Ohm resistor will take\u24230.35A from\u24235-V supply, according to Ohm's Law.\u21b5If there is another load, say\u24235 V\u24231 A, then it will take its own\u24231A, so the PSU will output\u24231.35 A total.\u21b5If the PSU says\u24235V\u24232.4 A, then it can't deliver more than\u24232.4A. If you try to connect a load\u2423 rated as\u24235V@6A, it means that the load has\u24230.833 Ohm resistance. If you will try to connect\u24230.833 Ohm to\u24235-V output, it will try to take\u24236 A. The PSU will just collapse and output nothing in best case, or smoke out in worst case. \u21b5In sum, the output current of a PSU will split itself between multiple parallel loads in accord with their corresponding load resistances, but only up to the PSU design capability. \u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n## Your Task\\n\\nBased on these examples, provide:\\n\\n1. **What does this feature detect?** What concept, pattern, or linguistic phenomenon triggers this feature?
