If you look at the cross tabs of that\u242310% (and here we get into issues of sample size, so beware) you see that they are distributed across the political and ideological spectrum, but those who say<< they>> will not vote on the question tend to share many non-political demographic traits with those who tend to support the amendment: high-school education and less then $40k income.\u21b5\u21b5I don't doubt that some of these people will not vote on the amendment, as they claim, but I also think that some amount of them will end up on one side or the other.\u21b5\u21b5I would guess that it probably ends up braking down that half of these people actually don't vote on the question while the other half split and half vote for, half against. Under that scenario, you get\u242349% for the amendment,\u242341% against and\u24235% not voting.

We examined the combined effects of hypertension and common mental disorder on mortality in participants with both treated and untreated hypertension. In a representative, prospective study of\u242331\u2423495 adults (aged\u242352.5 \u00b1\u242312.5 years,\u242345.7% men) we measured baseline levels of common mental disorder using the\u242312-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and collected data on blood pressure, history of hypertension diagnosis, and medication use. High blood pressure (systolic/diastolic >140/90 mmHg) in study<< members>> with an existing diagnosis of hypertension indicated uncontrolled hypertension and, in undiagnosed individuals, untreated hypertension. There were\u24233200 deaths from all causes [943 cardiovascular disease (CVD)] over\u24238.4 years follow-up. As expected, the risk of CVD was elevated in participants with controlled [multivariate hazard ratio =\u24231.63,\u242395% confidence interval (CI)\u24231.26-2.12] and uncontrolled (multivariate hazard ratio =\u24231.57,\u242395% CI\u24231.08-2.27) hypertension compared with normotensive participants. Common mental disorder (GHQ-12 score of \u22654) was also associated with CVD death (multivariate hazard ratio =\u24231.60,\u242395% CI\u24231.35-1.90). The risk of CVD death was highest in participants with both diagnosed hypertension and common mental disorder, especially in study members with controlled (multivariate hazard ratio =\u24232.32,\u242395% CI\u24231.70-3.17) hypertension but also in uncontrolled hypertension (multivariate hazard ratio =\u24231.90,\u242395% CI\u24231.18-3.05). The combined effect of common mental disorder was also apparent in participants with undiagnosed (untreated) hypertension, especially for all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that the association of hypertension with total and CVD mortality is stronger when combined with common mental disorder.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.312**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>alloy\u2423304 stainless steel\u21b5\u21b5We specializes in alloy\u2423304 stainless steel.

I'm delighted to see it evolving at a steady pace this last year or two, with up<<starts>> like Bronx Brewery, SingleCut, Rockaway Brewing Co., plus quite a few more upstate. Bronx has a doubly interesting approach, in that the brewery only produces multiple variants of its pale ale. There's a lot you can do with just a pale ale, but if you're gonna go for something so specific, you better have a solid base beer to build around, right? Well, small as they are, I got to try a few of Bronx's pale ale variants before ever drinking their core beer. But, like Sixpoint before them, Bronx recently teamed up with an out-of-state brewery to contract-brew and release their flagship beer in (stylish) cans, meaning I finally get to review this new entry into the New York market.\u21b5\u21b5Pouring a clear, copper / burgundy color, and with a\u24236.3% ABV, Bronx pale ale is going for something a bit heavier and maltier than an IPA while nudging into a similar ABV range. I respect that \u2014 it supports the notion that pale ales are about balance between malts and hops whereas IPAs are about pure hoppiness, even if there is some ABV overlap. The nose is sweet caramel malt and citrusy hops \u2014 classic. You know this one is going to be a bit sweeter just based on the color \u2014 Bronx Pale Ale must have a healthy dose of crystal malt in there \u2014 but the malts add some interesting depth on their own, with a mild nutty, bready character, rather than just the syrupy caramel-sweetness I dread. They're balanced by a solid bitterness and a bright fruity/floral hop character, exemplifying those vibrant American C hops. There's not a huge depth of hoppiness, but Cascade and Centennial are used to their best, capturing some of those original craft pale ale flavors while still seeming fresh and satisfying.\u21b5\u21b5Get this one fresh, or the malts will quickly take over.

Jos\u00e9 E. L\u00f3pez, Executive Director of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center, and State Representative Maria Antonia \u201cToni\u201d Berrios spoke about the importance of supporting people with HIV and fighting homophobia within the Latino community. The group marched in a procession to Roberto Clemente High School holding candles, carrying signs that read \u201cFighting for a Cure\u201d, and calling out the names of those who had passed away.\u21b5\u21b5Also, partaking in the World AIDS Day event was the With Me Comes a Cure [WMCC] program of Vida/SIDA. This HIV/STI Initiative, which is geared for youth between the ages of\u242313-24, is a collaborative effort between Vida/SIDA, the Community of Wellness, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. For World AIDS Day, WMCC sponsored a t-shirt contest for high school students from Clemente, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos, and Aspira; the students where asked to submit designs with a message relating to World AIDS Day and HIV/AIDS.\u21b5Following the vigil, everyone gathered at Roberto Clemente High School for the reception dinner.\u21b5\u21b5The program included a presentation from Dr. Jaime Mart\u00ednez from the Core Center, about treatment barriers unique to HIV-positive immigrants. Zenaida L\u00f3pez, Associate Director of Vida/SIDA, announced the winner of the t-shirt contest, followed by a female<< drag>> performer, Venus, who delighted the crowd with a colorful performance.\u21b5Armando Esquivel from Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was the winner of the t-shirt contest and the runner up was Luis Ram\u00edrez from Clemente. The winning design was printed on\u2423150 t-shirts, and to close the event, t-shirts where passed out to all those in attendance.\u21b5\u21b5Vida/SIDA and community partners are working to educate the community about HIV transmission, encourage safer sex practices that can prevent new cases, and help those who are positive, access affordable and respectful care.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.289**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Effective in vivo induction of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells by pretreatment with a streptococcal preparation, OK-432.\u21b5Effects of a streptococcal preparation, OK-432, on precursors of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells were observed in vivo. Total number of splenocytes and the ratio of asGM1+ cells increased gradually after i.v. administration of OK-432, reaching their peaks at\u24233 to\u24234 days. It was found that asGM1+ cells were nonadherent and large in size. There were little differences in the ratios of Thy-1+, Lyt-2+, and L3T4+ cells before and after OK-432 treatment. Mice were injected i.p. with recombinant interleukin\u24232 (rIL-2) at a dose of\u24235 x\u242310(4) U per mouse\u24234 days after OK-432 administration and LAK activity in their splenocytes was examined using natural killer (NK) resistant EL-4 target cells. Splenocytes in mice treated with both OK-432 and rIL-2 showed higher LAK activity than those in mice treated with rIL-2 alone. In vivo treatment with anti asGM1 antibody prior to rIL-2 injection abolished completely such augmentation of LAK activity in OK-432 treated mice. These results demonstrated that asGM1+ LAK precursor cells<< induced>> by OK-432 were effectively differentiated into LAK cells by rIL-2.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.287**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity and gestagen concentrations in bovine cotyledons and caruncles during gestation and parturition.\u21b53 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) activity in bovine cotyledons was much higher than in caruncles throughout the gestation period.

The fluctuation of\u242317 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone concentration in cotyledons was different from that of progesterone and\u242320 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone.

Women who are pregnant with girls do not carry half of their grandchildren. The eggs that a woman is born with are not the eggs that she will use to have children.

This egg will either be fertilized by sperm and develop into a fetus, or it will not be fertilized and the woman will have a menstrual period. The number of eggs that a woman has in her ovaries does not affect whether she gives birth to a boy or a girl.

These metals are usually present in the form of impurities or contaminants and are not intentionally added to the glass mix.\u21b5\u21b5During the manufacturing process, the glass is heated to very high temperatures, which can cause some of the heavy metals to become incorporated into the glass itself.

Fennel essential oil is known for its anise or licorice-like aroma, while fennel seed essential oil has a more sweet and spicy scent. Both types of essential oil are used in aromatherapy, massage, and other natural remedies for a variety of ailments.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5is Oreganum Onites different than oreganum vulgare<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Oreganum onites and oreganum vulgare are two different species of oregano. Oreganum onites is commonly known as \\\"wild oregano\\\" or \\\"mountain oregano\\\", it is native to the Mediterranean region and is considered to be more pungent and bitter than the more commonly used oregano, Oreganum vulgare. Oreganum vulgare, also known as \\\"garden oregano\\\" or \\\"Italian oregano\\\" is a domesticated variety of oregano that is widely cultivated for its culinary and medicinal properties. It has a milder, sweeter flavor than wild oregano. Both species have similar medicinal properties and are used to treat a wide range of ailments, including digestive problems, respiratory issues, and skin conditions.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5how can someone use oregano essential oil to treat respiratory congestion<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5Oregano essential oil can be used to help alleviate respiratory congestion by inhaling it through the nose or by adding a few drops to a steam inhalation. The oil's antimicrobial properties can help to clear the respiratory tract and ease coughing and congestion. It can also be added to a diffuser to help purify the air and make breathing easier.\u21b5Additionally, you can add a few drops of oregano essential oil to a hot bath and inhale the steam, or you can mix it with a carrier oil such as coconut oil and apply it topically to the chest.

Cost: Pouring concrete is usually less expensive than installing metal posts. This is because it is a simpler process that does not require construction equipment or specialized skills.\u21b52. Saving time: Pouring concrete and placing metal posts can take longer than just pouring concrete. This is because it is a more complex process that requires multiple steps, such as setting the posts in place and pouring the concrete to secure them in place.\u21b53. Compatibility: Some types of concrete and metal posts are not compatible with each other. For example, if you are pouring concrete and plan to install metal posts later, you may need to choose a type of concrete that is compatible with the type of metal posts you plan to use.\u21b54. Aesthetics: Pouring concrete can give a more rustic or natural look to your fence, while installing metal posts can give a more modern or industrial look.\u21b5In general, it is a good idea to consider these factors and choose the option that best meets your needs and budget.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Please create a list of items needed to build chainlink fence<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b51.

Post Holes: If the fence is being built in an area with very hard or rocky soil, it may be necessary to dig postholes to a depth that will allow the posts to be set at the proper depth. Placing the posts in the holes before pouring the concrete allows the concrete to flow around the posts and set properly, ensuring that they are securely in place.\u21b52. Concrete Consolidation: Concrete needs to be properly consolidated in order to achieve the desired strength and durability. Placing the posts in the holes before pouring the concrete allows the concrete to be consolidated around the posts, which helps to ensure that the posts are properly supported and that the fence will be strong and stable.\u21b53. Post Alignment: If the fence is being built on uneven ground or if the posts are being placed at an angle, it may be necessary to use shims or other devices to ensure that the posts are properly aligned. Placing the posts in the holes before pouring the concrete allows for any necessary adjustments to be made before the concrete is poured, ensuring that the posts are perfectly aligned and level.\u21b54. Weather: If the fence is being built in inclement weather, it may be necessary to pour the concrete first and let it cure before installing the posts. However, if the weather is dry and calm, it may be more convenient to place the posts in the holes before pouring the concrete, as it will allow the posts to be set in place and the concrete to be poured without delay.\u21b5\u21b5Ultimately, the decision of whether to pour the concrete first or place the posts in the holes before pouring the concrete will depend on the specific conditions of the job site and the preferences of the person building the fence.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Please create a list of items needed to build chainlink fence<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5Here is a list of items that you may need to build a chain link fence:\u21b5\u21b51.

Posts: You will need posts to support the fence panels, and the number and size of the posts will depend on the height and weight of the fence.\u21b53. Concrete: You will need concrete to set the posts in the ground.\u21b54.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 2.891**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5What is the difference between a vaccine and an immunization?<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5A vaccine and immunization are similar terms that refer to the process of protecting a person from a specific disease. However, the two terms are not exactly the same.\u21b5\u21b5A vaccine is a specific preparation of a killed microorganism, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease. In other words, a vaccine is a product that is designed to stimulate the immune system to produce immunity to a particular disease, and it contains a small amount of the virus or bacteria that causes the disease.\u21b5\u21b5Immunization, on the other hand, refers to the process of becoming immune or resistant to a specific disease, usually through the administration of a vaccine. Immunization can also refer to the process of developing immunity to a disease through natural infection or through other means, such as exposure to the disease or the use of certain medications.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, a vaccine is a specific product that is used to immunize people against a particular disease, while immunization refers to the process of becoming immune to a disease through the use of a vaccine or other means.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5ARe vaccines only given tto cattle?<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>>\u21b5\u21b5No, vaccines are not only given to cattle.

Some vaccines are also used to protect wild animals and endangered species.\u21b5\u21b5Vaccines are also an important tool in human medicine. They are used to prevent and control infectious diseases in humans, including seasonal flu, measles, mumps, rubella, and many others.

Porter left the West Wing last week after serving for more than a year as White House staff secretary - the main person handling paperwork for the president, including a lot of sensitive, classified information. He did that with a temporary security clearance. The White House said his background check process was still ongoing when Porter left. But today, FBI Director Chris Wray said the bureau closed its books on the investigation weeks before. Well, NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is here to shed light on all of this. Hey, Mara.\u21b5\u21b5MARA LIASSON, BYLINE<<:>> Hi there.\u21b5\u21b5KELLY: So the FBI director pretty much upended the White House version of events.

The White House claimed the investigation was ongoing. Chris Wray today said it was finished.

That's the office that would make the final determination about who gets a clearance...\u21b5\u21b5KELLY: OK.\u21b5\u21b5LIASSON:...Even though the FBI had finished its investigation. The problem is is that that isn't what they've been saying until today.

But ultimately - you [said] in the beginning that this war in effect took the place of World War III. How close did we come to World War III, to this war turning into World War III?\u21b5\u21b5Stueck<<:>><< Well>>, that's arguable. Some historians have suggested that I have argued that we were a bit closer than we actually were. It is clear that Stalin did not want a third world war. And it's clear that American leaders, by in large, in Washington at least, did not want a third world war. But had the United States expanded the war into Manchuria in\u24231951, it might very well have split apart the Western alliance in a manner that would have made Stalin believe he had a great opportunity in Europe. That is to say that if our allies in NATO split with us on expanding the war in Korea, and the American ability to cooperate with the Europeans in developing a defense in Europe against a possible Soviet conventional attack had been undermined, then the possibility that Stalin would have seen an opportunity to move into Western Europe with conventional forces would have been substantially increased.\u21b5\u21b5I think there's one other thing here that's very interesting about the later period - that is, early\u24231953. Stalin of course died in early March of\u24231953, and there's a new book just coming out that argued that he was actually killed by his underlings, perhaps Berea, perhaps a couple of others. And that this action by Stalin's underlings may well have been related to the fact that he refused to end the Korean War and that he might very well have been willing to accept a global confrontation with the United States. Now, we don't have definitive evidence to that effect. But certainly that was the other period, early\u24231953 when a new administration had come in in Washington under Dwight Eisenhower, an administration that was determined to end the war after a long stalemate in negotiations, and was certainly making noises about expanding the war in the Communists did not accept an armistice on our terms.\u21b5\u21b5So that really the two times when there was a significant chance of the war expanding into a global war were December\u24231950 through, oh, January of\u24231951\u2026and then in the winter and spring of\u24231953.

What is it and what does it cover?\u21b5\u21b5LANKFORD<<:>><< Well>>, long-term-care insurance covers care whether it's in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or in your own home. And it provides a daily benefit so you get to pay for that care and can really protect your retirement savings. So this policy, it provides the cost to help pay for all or part of that care if you end up needing help with activities of daily living, or if you have cognitive impairment. So there's these specific triggers and then it'll pay out to pay for that care.\u21b5\u21b5GREENE: You're saying protect your retirement savings, these - all the money you save for retirement, you can actually use it for retirement, as opposed to having been forced to use that money on your care in a nursing home...\u21b5\u21b5LANKFORD: That's exactly right.

This software framework is often called the audio engine.\u21b5This software is able to determine which sound effect shall be played and what are it's characteristic in relation to the player's position and orientation.\u21b5Examples :\u21b5A NPC walking will trigger footsteps coming from where this NPC is relatively to the player's position, with an intensity and effects (reverberation, attenuation, filtering,...) depending on the distance to the player and the environment.\u21b5Once the software knows where from and with which effects a given localized sound effect must be rendered, the mix engine must compute how this is to be rendered in a given listening environment (stereo loudspeakers,\u24235.1 loudspeakers, headphones).\u21b5In the case of headphones, it can use binaural rendering to position the effect in a\u24233D space for the headphone listener. It uses a model called Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) that gives what filtering to apply to simulate a given\u24233D position in the headset listening. This is usually an approximation as each human head has it's own HRTF depending on the head size, shape of the ears and other parameters. But an average HRTF can give some results satisfying most listeners.\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.652**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Screen Machine Industries - Portable Crushers, Screening.\u21b5\u21b5Screen Machine Industries is a leading manufacturer of portable jaw, impact and cone rock crushers, screening plants, trommels and conveyors and a global leader in design and innovation within the industry.

Is that a fair assessment, and as a player how is he different, if at all, from before?\u21b5\u21b5Jenn Menendez<<:>> James Conner is quite a person, and quite a player. That said, I think he is very close to being the player he was in\u24232014, as the last remnants of rust seem to shake off his back. Further, I would say even his not-quite-100 percent would be an enviable level for a lot of college running backs. Long story short, he has \u2013 and probably will \u2013 continue to get better as each game passes this season.\u21b5\u21b5AC: Through three games Pitt has allowed an average of\u24232.4 yards per rush, but not many teams are giving up as many yards per pass attempt as the Panthers (who are allowing\u24238.8 yards per attempt). What's with the discrepancy between Pitt's excellent run defense and porous pass defense?\u21b5\u21b5JM: Pitt tries to stop the run first and foremost and sometimes that leaves them vulnerable in the secondary. They got burned a few times on big pass plays against Penn State, but to a manageable level. Different story against Oklahoma State which is what is skewing those numbers so badly. The Cowboys exploited every mismatch and miscommunication to amass\u2423540 passing yards on the way to a win.\u21b5\u21b5AC: We've heard a lot down here this week of how UNC plans to deal with Pitt's jet sweeps with Quadree Henderson. How much of an integral part of the Panthers' offense is the jet sweep and what makes Henderson so effective in that role?\u21b5\u21b5JM: Henderson has been the team's most dynamic playmaker in three games so far this season, for his receiving ability, return game, and executing on those jet sweeps that appeared to catch Penn State off guard.

Some background: I work for Lookback, and our\u21b5main thing is doing video recordings of remote user research (UX) sessions.\u21b5For the \\\"remote\\\" part we use our in-house built WebRTC server network. At some\u21b5point last year we got fed up with Slack calls, Zoom, Appear In, etc and said\u21b5to ourselves \\\"hey, we got this tech ourselves, let's use it!\\\" So we've made\u21b5this chat and used it for our meetings for over a year now, and it is time to\u21b5share the joy :)\u21b5\u21b5We share it for free now and we hope it will take off. If it is successful, we\u21b5will think about bandwidth costs and monetization later. One thing this does\u21b5give us already now is \\\"free testing\\\" of our Live server infra.

If\u21b5it takes off, we also plan to build native mobile clients (no cross platform\u21b5frameworks).\u21b5\u21b5Details: It's a full mesh network built on AWS where we put a server in every\u21b5available AWS region. It's not using WebRTC peer-to-peer but instead opts for\u21b5client-server. This obviously has privacy drawbacks, but recall our main\u21b5business is _recording_ live sessions, so even if we don't (yet) allow\u21b5recording of meetings, the solution is mainly for that scenario. However our\u21b5experience is that client-server typically works better for meetings spread\u21b5out over the globe because AWS internal transits are much faster than the open\u21b5internet.\u21b5\u21b5We're trying to do privacy right, I wrote some about it here:\u21b5[https://tinyurl.com/y9mv9jgm](https://tinyurl.com/y9mv9jgm)\u21b5\u21b5Happy to answer any questions about the tech or otherwise!\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 3 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.312**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>---\u21b5abstract: 'We present a catalog of\u2423535 planetary nebulae discovered in the flattened elliptical galaxy NGC\u24234697, using the FORS1 Cassegrain spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal, Chile.

(2001, in what follows Paper I). The interpretation of the most important result, which can be described as a Keplerian decline of line-of-sight velocity dispersion as a function of angular distance from the center of the galaxy, has been quite difficult. Several theoretical groups are working on the development of better numerical models, including three-integral models better adapted to a flattened dynamical system like NGC\u24234697. We have decided to publish the catalog now, so as to make it available to all interested groups. We have recalculated the radial velocities in one of the observed fields, using a different procedure than the one described in Paper I. After confirming that no important changes were necessary, we have combined the two sets of measurements into one final catalog. The catalog provides positions ($x, y$ coordinates relative to the center of light of NGC\u2423<<469>>7, as well as $\\\\\\\\alpha, \\\\\\\\delta$), and, for almost all PNs, the magnitude $m$(5007) and the heliocentric radial velocity in km s$^{-1}$.\u21b5\u21b5We also provide a list of peculiar, mostly emission-line objects that are not planetary nebulae, for eventual future studies. In section\u24232 we describe the radial velocity recalculations mentioned above, and compare the new versus the old velocities.

Based on documentation it seems this should be possible, but based on the comments on Stack Overflow and what we\u00b4ve seen, this only works if the school uses SDS and if we use Application, not Delegated permissions. \u21b5We want to determine somehow if a pupil is taught by a teacher. We can\u00b4t see any clear way we can do this. The only way we can figure something out is to scan through all the classes of the pupil and then find those classes where the user is an owner/teaches those classes.\u21b5\u21b5A<<:\u21b5\u21b5>>You<< don>>'t technically need to be using School Data Sync (SDS), but it does make the data a bit easier to work with and more consistent.

This is often a non-trivial exercise. \u21b5That said, there are a few ways to determine if a User is a Student or a Teacher without relying on the primaryRole.

However, his most lasting achievement may be his contribution to modern slang. According to legend, Radbourn was rounding the bases after hitting a home run when his leg muscles suddenly seized up, causing him to collapse to the ground like a sack of potatoes. The incident prompted a teammate to shout, \\\"What's the matter with you, Charley Hoss?\\\" The name stuck and leg cramps have been referred to as Charley horses ever since.\u21b5\u21b5Ryan\u21b5\u21b5bowled over\u21b5\u21b5Hey Ryan, did you see that Barack Obama bowled a\u242337 this week on a promotional stop?\u21b5\u21b5James, Santa Cruz, CA\u21b5\u21b5I did, James.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, I notice a clear pattern: this feature activates strongly when there's a question-answer format, particularly in contexts where:\\n\\n1.

In pretraining examples, the feature activates on \\\"A:\\\" markers or similar answer indicators in Q&A formatted text, though with lower scores (1.2-1.6).\\n\\nThe common thread is the transition point between a question being asked and an answer being provided. The feature seems to detect the structural pattern of question-answer exchanges, particularly the formatting elements that signal \\\"here comes the answer\\\" - whether that's newlines after an assistant header in chat format, or \\\"A:\\\" markers in traditional Q&A text.\\n\\nThis is fundamentally about detecting a linguistic/structural pattern rather than any specific entity or behavior.

The dependent variable in a linear regression model is assumed to be normally distributed and the relationship between the variables is modeled using a linear equation.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, the main difference between a generalized linear model and a regression model is the type of response variable that can be modeled.

While it is true that many animals, including humans, have cells in their eyes called cone cells that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light and allow them to perceive colors, the specific wavelengths of light that an animal is sensitive to can vary greatly from that of a human. In the case of bulls, it is not known what specific colors they are able to perceive or how they might respond to them.\u21b5\u21b5One thing to consider is that many animals, including bulls, are thought to be more sensitive to certain wavelengths of light than others. For example, some animals are thought to be more sensitive to blue and yellow light than to red light. This is because the cones in their eyes are more sensitive to these wavelengths, which allows them to better perceive colors in their environment. However, without more information about the specific wavelengths of light that bulls are sensitive to, it is not possible to say for sure how they might perceive the color red or how they might respond to it.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 31.125**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>system\u21b5You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

There are several models that can be used for this purpose, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific use case and the desired level of complexity.\u21b5\u21b5Some popular models for image embeddings include:\u21b5\u21b51. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited for image classification and feature extraction tasks. CNNs can be trained to learn high-level features from images, which can be used for tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and image similarity search.\u21b52. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These are a type of deep learning model that consist of two components: a generator network that produces images, and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish the generated images from real images. GANs can be used to learn a compact and meaningful representation of images that can be used for tasks such as image synthesis and image-to-image translation.\u21b53. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): These are a type of deep learning model that consist of an encoder network that maps images to a latent space, and a decoder network that maps the latent space back to the image space. VAEs can be used to learn a probabilistic representation of images that can be used for tasks such as image generation and image compression.\u21b54. Residual Networks (ResNets): These are a type of deep learning model that are designed to learn hierarchical representations of images. ResNets can be used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\u21b5\u21b5When choosing a model for image embeddings, it is important to consider the specific use case and the desired level of complexity. For example, if the goal is to perform simple image classification, a CNN may be sufficient. If the goal is to perform more complex tasks such as image synthesis or image-to-image translation, a GAN or VAE may be more appropriate.\u21b5\u21b5It is also important to ensure that the model is trained on a large and diverse dataset of images, and that the model is regularly evaluated for accuracy and fairness. This can help to ensure that the model is learning meaningful and useful representations of images, and that<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 30.875**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>system\u21b5You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

In an adiabatic process, the number of accessible states remains constant because the energy levels of the system change smoothly with time, and the system can remain in its initial state throughout the process. This is known as the adiabatic theorem.\u21b5\u21b5In the case of a quantum system, the theorem states that if the Hamiltonian of the system changes slowly enough, the wave function of the system will evolve smoothly and the system will remain in its initial state throughout the process. This means that the number of accessible states will remain constant during a quasi-static process.\u21b5\u21b5It is important to note that the adiabatic theorem applies only to quasi-static processes, where the rate of change of the Hamiltonian is much slower than the energy levels of the system. In faster processes, the system may not have enough time to adjust its energy to match the changing Hamiltonian, and the number of accessible states may change.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5clarify what you mean by the system not having enough time to adjust its energy to match the changing Hamiltonian<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5In a fast process, the rate of change of the Hamiltonian may be so fast that the system cannot adjust its energy to match the changing Hamiltonian in time. This can happen when the system is subjected to a sudden change in the Hamiltonian, such as a sudden change in an external field or a sudden change in the coupling between system and environment.\u21b5\u21b5In such cases, the system may not have enough time to adjust its energy to match the new Hamiltonian before the next sudden change occurs. As a result, the system may become disentangled from its initial state, and the number of accessible states may change.\u21b5\u21b5For example, consider a two-level system that is initially in its ground state. If the Hamiltonian of the system is suddenly changed to include a term that couples the two levels, the system will become entangled with the environment and the number of accessible states will increase. This is because the system is no longer confined to a single energy level, and the environment can now interact with both energy levels.\u21b5\u21b5In general, the rate of change of the Hamiltonian determines the time scale for the system to adjust its\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 30.875**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>system\u21b5You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.

In fact, a feedforward neural network can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the nodes represent the neurons and the edges represent the directed connections between them. This graphical representation of a feedforward neural network is similar to the graphical models used in other fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. The graphical model allows us to represent complex relationships between variables and make predictions about the output of the network based on the input data.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5Now if we assign the weights to its corresponding neuron, can we use inference algorithms such as belief propagation to learn those weights?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5In general, it is not possible to use belief propagation or other inference algorithms to directly learn the weights of a feedforward neural network. This is because the weights of a neural network are learned through an optimization process, such as gradient descent, that minimizes a loss function defined over the network's output. The optimization process adjusts the weights to minimize the loss, and the resulting weights are the solution to the optimization problem.\u21b5\u21b5However, it is possible to use graphical models and inference algorithms to perform hyperparameter optimization for neural networks. For example, Bayesian optimization can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of a neural network, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of layers, by using a probabilistic model of the performance of the network. The probabilistic model is updated after each iteration of the optimization process, allowing the algorithm to make more informed decisions about which hyperparameters to adjust next.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, while belief propagation and other inference algorithms cannot directly learn the weights of a feedforward neural network, they can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of the network, which can improve its performance.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5typically belief propagation can be seen as message passing and so can backpropagation, is there any relation between those two methods?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5Yes, there is a relationship between belief propagation and backpropagation.

This means that they can accept input texts of different lengths and still produce meaningful outputs.\u21b5\u21b5The key to how transformer models handle variable-length input is their use of a mechanism called \\\"padding\\\". When the input sequence is shorter than the specified length, the model pads the sequence with zeros to make it the same length as the input layer. Similarly, when the input sequence is longer than the specified length, the model truncates the sequence to make it the same length as the input layer.\u21b5\u21b5The idea behind this padding mechanism is that the model should be able to process input sequences of any length, and that the length of the input sequence should not be a determining factor in the model's ability to generate an output.\u21b5\u21b5It's worth noting that while transformer models can handle variable-length input sequences, they are typically trained on fixed-length input sequences. This means that the model is optimized to generate output sequences that are the same length as the input sequence, and that it may not perform as well on variable-length input sequences as it does on fixed-length input sequences.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5What is the curvier beaked whale?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|><<assistant>>\u21b5The curvier beaked whale, also known as the curvier's beaked whale, is a species of cetacean that belongs to the family Ziphiidae. It is one of the lesser-known beaked whale species and is found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\u21b5\u21b5The curvier beaked whale is characterized by its distinctively curved mouth, which gives it its name. It has a slender body with a long, curved snout, and its back is usually a dark gray color with a lighter underside. Adults can grow to be up to\u24239 meters in length and weigh around\u242313 tons.\u21b5\u21b5These whales are known to be relatively rare and elusive, and not much is known about their behavior and ecology. They are generally solitary animals and are thought to feed primarily on squid and fish. They are also known to be highly migratory, traveling thousands of kilometers each year.\u21b5\u21b5The curvier beaked whale is considered to be a vulnerable species, with an estimated population of around\u242310,000 individuals. Threats to their survival include entanglement in fishing gear, ship\\n```\\n\\n### Pretraining Examples  \\n**Example 1 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.531**\\n```\\nFollow Us\u21b5\u21b5Ask an Eye M.D. Answer Archive\u21b5\u21b5Question:In dimly lit room, I see a dark large spot that is steadily increasing in size.

I like that it has launched a whole ecosystem of inexpensive and readily available peripherals. I don't like the clunky IDE, the bizarre terms (like sketch), and the fan boy culture surrounding it. Perhaps part of what I don't like is the lack of innovation. At the core, the Arduino is nothing more than an Atmel chip, a bootloader, and the GNU C compiler. There's also a very simple (and hardly necessary) C language framework and a truly bad Java-based IDE that's only good feature is the way it integrates libraries (well, until you look at how it does it under the covers, but that's another topic).\u21b5\u21b5Webcasts\u21b5\u21b5All that applies to the traditional Arduino. However, I recently picked up an Arduino Leonardo board. It still suffers from the horrible IDE (and I talked about how to avoid the IDE before). It does, however, add something very powerful. USB support.\u21b5\u21b5It is true that some Arduino boards \u2014 maybe even most \u2014 have a USB port. But that USB port essentially was a serial-to-USB adapter built on the board, not an integral part of the Arduino. The Leonardo's USB port is a real USB port accessible by the CPU. It still looks like a serial port for downloading and debugging your software. It can also look like a keyboard or a mouse! It can even look like all three devices at the same time.\u21b5\u21b5As usual, the Arduino provides a clean library that's easy to use, so building an alternate keyboard or mouse becomes drop-dead simple. I've talked about building HID devices before and it wasn't that simple. Actually, it wasn't simple at all.\u21b5\u21b5In the past, when I've used an Arduino it has been because they are readily available, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a project.

Using a single-use plastic bottle has a larger impact on the environment as it takes a long time to decompose in the environment, and it also releases harmful chemicals into the soil and water. In contrast, using a reusable bottle helps reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills, reduces the amount of plastic that gets into the environment and helps reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in the ocean.\u21b5In terms of human health, using a single-use plastic bottle can lead to the release of harmful chemicals into the environment and can also lead to the exposure of harmful chemicals to humans. This can have severe health consequences, including but not limited to, skin irritation, breathing problems, and other health issues. Using a reusable bottle helps reduce the exposure to harmful chemicals as it is made of safe materials that are safe to use and dispose of.\u21b5In conclusion, using a single-use plastic bottle can have severe implications on both the environment and human health, while using a reusable bottle has the potential to reduce these implications.<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 19.000**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5What are some of the current challenges and controversies in the field of artificial intelligence, and how are researchers working to address these issues and advance the technology further<<?>><|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>Some of the current challenges and controversies in the field of AI include bias and fairness, privacy and security, and the impact of AI on jobs and the economy.

During the past decade, new advanced therapies for PAH have emerged and progress in high-risk pregnancy management has been made. We examined whether these changes have improved outcomes in parturients with PAH. A systematic review of all cases of parturients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (iPAH), congenital heart disease associated with PAH (CHD-PAH), or PAH of other aetiology (oPH) published in the past decade (1997-2007) was performed. Outcome data from this study were then compared with relevant data published between\u24231978 and\u24231996. Forty-eight case reports or case series met the inclusion criteria, totalling\u242373 parturients with PAH. Seventy-two per cent of patients with iPAH were receiving advanced therapies, compared with\u242352% of CHD-PAH and\u242347% of oPH. Although a publication bias cannot be excluded, overall maternal mortality was significantly lower compared with previous era (25 vs.\u242338%, P =\u24230.047) and was\u242317% in iPAH,\u242328% in CHD-PAH, and\u242333% in oPH. Seventy-eight per cent of deaths occurred within the first month after delivery. Primigravidae and parturients who received general anaesthesia were at higher risk of death (OR\u24233.70,\u242395% CI\u24231.15-12.5, P =\u24230.03 and OR\u24234.37,\u242395% CI\u24231.28-16.50, P =\u24230.02, respectively). Maternal mortality in parturients with PAH remains prohibitively high, despite lower death rates than previous decades. Early advice on pregnancy risks, including contraception, remains paramount. Women with PAH who become pregnant warrant a multidisciplinary approach with consideration of advanced therapies.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 8.375**\\n```\\nDevelop business strategies by identifying the key market categories and segments poised for strong growth<<.\u21b5>>Develop market-entry and market expansion strategies.\u21b5Design competition strategies by identifying who-stands-where in the Mexico Wound Care Management competitive landscape.\u21b5Develop capital investment strategies by identifying the key market segments expected to register strong growth in the near future.\u21b5<<What>> are the key distribution channels and whats the most preferred mode of product distribution Identify, understand and capitalize.\u21b5\u21b5About ResearchMoz\u21b5ResearchMoz is the one stop online destination to find and buy market research reports & Industry Analysis.

Effects of shading by early canopy closure on reproductive output and vegetative growth, however, may vary depending on the seasonal allocation patterns of photosynthetic products between current reproduction and storage for future growth in each species. To clarify the effects of sink-source balance on seed production and bulb growth in a spring ephemeral herb, Gagea lutea, we performed a bract removal treatment (source reduction) and a floral-bud removal treatment (sink reduction) under canopy and open conditions. Leaf carbon fixations did not differ between the forest and open sites and among treatments. Bract carbon fixations were also similar between sites but tended to decrease when floral buds were removed. Seed production was higher under open condition but decreased by the bract-removal treatment under both light conditions. In contrast, bulb growth was independent of light conditions and the bract-removal treatment but increased greatly by the bud-removal treatment. Therefore, leaves and bracts acted as specialized source organs for vegetative and reproductive functions, respectively, but photosynthetic products by bracts were flexibly used for bulb growth when plants failed to set fruits. Extension of bright period was advantageous for seed production (i.e., source limited) but not for vegetative growth (i.e., sink limited) in this species.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 8.188**\\n```\\nCan surgery for cancer accelerate the progression of secondary tumors within residual minimal disease at both local and systemic levels<<?\u21b5>><<S>>urgical removal remains the principal treatment modality in the management of lung cancer.

C57/BL6 mice [10/group] underwent a mammary fat pad inoculation of\u24233LL cells [5 x\u242310(5)/animal] and were divided into two groups. Group\u24231 served as control while mice in group\u24232 were further subdivided into groups\u24232A and\u24232B. After\u24232 weeks, all mice in\u24232A were killed, and primary tumors and lungs were excised. At\u24232 weeks, primary tumors were excised completely for all mice in group\u24232B. These mice were then recovered and recurrent tumor growth evaluated for a further\u24232 weeks. Four weeks from the onset of the study, all remaining primary tumors and lungs were excised from groups\u24231 and\u24232. After\u24234 weeks undisturbed growth, primary tumors in group\u24231 reached a mean size of\u24232.85 +/-\u24230.33 cm. After\u24232 weeks growth, primary tumors in groups\u24232A and\u24232B were comparable at\u24231.36 +/-\u24230.44 m and\u24231.53 +/-\u24230.29 cm, respectively. Two weeks after primary tumor excision, recurrent tumors in group\u24232B had reached a mean size of\u24232.65 +/-\u24230.74 cm. Moreover, for several animals, recurrent tumors rapidly reached similar volumes to that of primary tumors in group\u24231. Primary tumors were typically encapsulated and nonadherent. In contrast, recurrent tumors were locally invasive and adherent to chest wall and wound. Interestingly, pulmonary metastatic burden was increased in group\u24232B relative to group\u24231. Histologic examination revealed increased mitosis in recurrent tumors when compared with primary tumors. Tumor removal is followed by accelerated growth of locally recurrent tumors and metastases. Moreover, recurrent tumors are more locally invasive than primary tumors. These findings strongly indicate that resection may be followed by tumor progression in residual disease.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 8.125**\\n```\\nDescribe key developments in the history of religion since ancient times<<.\u21b5\u21b5>>List the major religions in the world today.\u21b5\u21b5Summarize the major functions of religion.\u21b5\u21b5Explain the views of religion held by the conflict and symbolic interactionist perspectives.\u21b5\u21b5Understand the differences among the major types of religious organizations.\u21b5\u21b5Religion is the set of beliefs and practices regarding sacred things that help a society understand the meaning and purpose of life. \u00c9mile Durkheim (1915/1947)Durkheim, E. (1947). The elementary forms of religious life (J. Swain, Trans.). Glencoe, IL: Free Press. (Original work published\u24231915)observed long ago that every society has beliefs about things that are supernatural and awe-inspiring and beliefs about things that are more practical and down-to-earth. He called the former beliefs sacred beliefs and the latter beliefs profane beliefs. Religious beliefs and practices involve the sacred: they involve things our senses cannot readily observe, and they involve things that inspire in us awe, reverence, and even fear.\u21b5\u21b5Durkheim did not try to prove or disprove religious beliefs. Religion, he acknowledged, is a matter of faith, and faith is not provable or disprovable through scientific inquiry. Rather, Durkheim tried to understand the role played by religion in social life and the impact on religion of social structure and social change. In short, he treated religion as a social institution.\u21b5\u21b5Sociologists since his time have treated religion in the same way. Anthropologists, historians, and other scholars have also studied religion. The remainder of this chapter reviews what we know about religion as a social institution and the role it plays in American life.\u21b5\u21b5A Brief History of Religion\u21b5\u21b5Every known society has practiced religion, although the nature of religious belief and practice has differed from one society to the next. Prehistoric people turned to religion to help them understand birth, death, and natural events such as hurricanes. They also relied on religion for help in dealing with their daily needs for existence: good weather, a good crop, an abundance of animals to hunt (Noss & Grangaard,\u24232008).Noss, D.

The question now, does this president enough to get lawmakers to ram through the kind of legislation that they couldn't agree on just last week.\u21b5\u21b5We're talking, of course, about immigration reform. And President Bush today went to great lengths trying to sell it, showing up for a rare lunch on Capitol Hill.\u21b5\u21b5CNN's Ed Henry, part of our reporting, Ed, did the president accomplish anything?\u21b5\u21b5ED HENRY, CNN CORRESPONDENT<<:>> Well, it's hard to tell, but I can tell you the stark assessment from one senior Republican close to the White House tonight told me basically he doesn't think the president changed a single vote today by going up to the Hill.\u21b5\u21b5But the president basically had no choice, but to go up there. He has to get\u242315 Senators to change their minds. That's not easy for any president, but it's even harder for a president who's inching closer and closer to lame duck status.\u21b5\u21b5And it was a stark reminder that when this president had to go hat in hand. You remember the first six years, seven years of this administration the president has gotten pretty much anything he wanted from a Republican Congress. Now the Democrats are running the show and the president had to make the case, once again, not just to Democrats but he was making it directly to Senate Republicans behind closed doors.\u21b5\u21b5(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But those of us standing here believe now is the time to move a comprehensive bill that enforces our borders and has good workplace enforcement that doesn't grant automatic citizenship, that addresses this problem in a comprehensive way.\u21b5\u21b5I would hope that the Senate majority leader has that same sense of desire to move the product as I do -- or the bill that I do -- and these Senators do because now is the time to get it done.\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 5.531**\\n```\\nCan I include my phone number/email address/link to my website/link to my FB page in my profile?\u21b5\u21b5<<No>>, you can't.\u21b5\u21b5Part of our terms and conditions is that every booking - whether it's a walk or boarding, a first booking or a repeat client - that results from a first contact via Pawshake, must be booked and paid through the site.

The entire park covers approximately\u2423415 square miles, meaning you have a huge selection of areas to backpack. One of the favorites is outside of Estes Park, a quaint little town with a big heart and even bigger history. This area of the park has massive alpine tundra that covers about\u242365% of this area.\u21b5\u21b5If you backpack on the lower section, you will be walking through ponderosa pine, juniper, and Douglas fir trees. Wildlife includes large herds of elk, coyotes, marmots, badgers, and bighorn sheep. Since this park offers more than\u2423355 miles of trails, it is considered among the best in the United States.\u21b5\u21b5The only downfall to backpacking in the Rocky Mountain National Park is that because it is so incredible here, people come from around the globe to get caught up in the experience. Therefore, fighting crowds is a possibility, even in the backcountry. In fact, each year more than three million people visit the Rocky Mountain\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.594**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>1.

The oil level drops below the warning threshold, which triggers the alert. The operator should check the machine for damage and ensure that there is adequate transmission fluid in the transmission. If the machine has not been operated for a long time, the operator should also replace the filters and check the oil type, level, and viscosity.\\n```\\n\\n### Pretraining Examples  \\n**Example 1 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 1.094**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Q:\u21b5\u21b5Is Lord Vishnu a Brahmin?\u21b5\u21b5I once saw an image of Lord Vishnu wearing a sacred thread which Brahmin's wear on their body.

This makes it hard for a<< computer>> to retain old lessons, but also to learn tasks that require a sequence of steps.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"Researchers will need to solve this problem of catastrophic forgetting for us to get anywhere in terms of producing artificially intelligent computers and robots,\\\" said Jeff Clune, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Wyoming. \\\"Until we do, machines will be mostly one-trick ponies.\\\"\u21b5\u21b5Catastrophic forgetting also stands in the way of one of the long-standing goals for artificial intelligence: to create computers that can compartmentalize different skills in order to solve diverse problems.\u21b5\u21b5So what would it take for a computer brain to retain what it knows, even as it learns new things? That was the question Clune had when he and his colleagues set out to make an artificial brain act more like a human one.

That's because natural selection arranges the brain to minimize the costs associated with building, maintaining, and housing broader connections.\u21b5\u21b5\\\"It is an interesting question as to how evolution solved this problem,\\\" Clune told me. \\\"How did it figure out how to allow animals, including us, to learn a new skill without over\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.703**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>Pages\u21b5\u21b5Wednesday, November\u242327,\u24232013\u21b5\u21b5Robot, take out the trash!\u21b5\u21b5I hate wheeling the trash to the curb on trash day and sometimes I forget.

I'm like a kid on Christmas opening the coolest new lego-lincoln-erector-tinker-riviton-toy ever designed!\u21b5\u21b5As it turns turns out, I've been wanting to build a trash robot for a few years now. After wondering \\\"what am I going to do with all these parts?\\\" for awhile, I decided the trash robot is the perfect project to see what the Actobotics platform can do for us robot-builders. It's going to take several weeks to build and I'm capturing it all here. Hope you'll tune in while I prototype, build, figure, calculate, screw up, fix, and all that joy.

To curb.\u21b5\u21b5I have rolling trash cans (pictured above) that need to get down the inclined driveway to the curb every Tuesday before\u24237:00AM, or by the same time on Wednesday if Monday was a national holiday.

I was too busy with music and writing and church to think about dating. (Notice I didn\u2019t mention studying!) Shortly after graduation, friends were getting hitched left and right. (This is Utah, where people marry young.) The marryin\u2019 age was no longer in the future; it was now. I had to consider whether marriage was realistic for me, someone who continued to experience same-sex attraction.\u21b5\u21b5On the night I \u201ccame out\u201d to my parents, I told them I still wanted a wife and kids, despite being attracted to men. They told me it was a good and godly desire, which I was free to pursue. (Such a beautiful response, by the way.) Looking back, I think my desire for marriage was actually a desire for things I believed would accompany marriage:\u24231) the \u201chealing\u201d or diminishing of my same-sex attractions, and\u24232) achieving the American dream, which included starting a family. I didn\u2019t desire marriage for what it was designed to be \u2014 a living expression of God\u2019s faithfulness to his people \u2014 I only wanted the perks (real or imagined).

There were some decent points, some of which I've talked about in other posts. I actually think that some of Greg's observations are also true of agency recruiters too! It's also important to realise there is a difference between an HR Generalist who deals with recruitment as part of their wider remit and an internal recruiter whose sole focus and specialism is recruitment.\u21b5\u21b5Inevitably I think there's always going to be this 'struggle' between client side and agency side. Personally I think one of the best ways to try and mitigate this is to realise that both sides of the fence need a better understanding of the others roles and in particular understand their objectives, responsibilities and the pressures which impact them on a day to day basis.\u21b5\u21b5Having worked on both the agency and now the client side I think this helps me to manage agency relationships in an effective way because I better understand what an agency recruiter is looking to achieve and what I might do to make things work more effectively; in line with my responsibilities and deliverables.\u21b5\u21b5Working client side has also made me realise that as an agency recruiter I didn't necessarily have a good enough understanding about what my contacts on the client side had to achieve. Perhaps with a better understanding it would have actually assisted me to achieve more, as well as benefit them.\u21b5\u21b5So whichever side of the recruitment fence you sit, try and view things through the eyes of your contact on the other side of the fence. Make it your business to understand their job more thoroughly and it might well mean that you both benefit.\u21b5\u21b5And that is the key right there - I am NOT HR. I am an internal recruiter, reporting to a Director of Recruiting. Our entire focus is recruiting.<< I>> leave HR to the HR peeps.<< There>> is a difference, as you said.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 2.875**\\n```\\nHello, I\\\\\\\\'m HatedLove6.

In the context of governance, decentralization can refer to the distribution of decision-making authority to lower levels of government or to local communities. Decentralization can also refer to the distribution of power within an organization, such as the delegation of authority to lower-level managers.\u21b5\u21b5Decentralization can have a number of benefits, including:\u21b5\u21b51. Increased efficiency: Decentralization can allow decisions to be made closer to the source of the problem or opportunity, which can lead to faster and more efficient decision-making.\u21b52. Improved accountability: Decentralization can make decision-makers more accountable for their actions, as they are not shielded by a central authority.\u21b53. Greater responsiveness: Decentralization can allow decision-makers to respond more quickly and effectively to local needs and circumstances.\u21b54. Increased innovation<<:>> Decentralization<< can>> allow<< for>><< more>> experimentation<< and>><< innovation>><<,>><< as>> lower-level decision-makers may be more willing to take risks<< than>> central authorities.\u21b55. Greater democracy: Decentralization can allow for more citizen participation in decision-making and can promote greater democracy and citizen engagement.\u21b5\u21b5However, decentralization can also have some potential drawbacks, including:\u21b5\u21b51. Increased complexity: Decentralization can lead to a more complex system of governance, as decision-making authority is distributed across multiple levels or entities.\u21b52. Lack of coordination: Decentralization can lead to a lack of coordination between different levels or entities, which can result in conflicting or inefficient decision-making.\u21b53. Inequality: Decentralization can result in unequal distribution of resources and decision-making power, which can exacerbate existing inequalities.\u21b54. Corruption: Decentralization can create opportunities for corruption, as decision-makers may be more vulnerable to bribes or other forms of corruption.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, the benefits and drawbacks of decentralization will depend on the specific context and goals of the system of governance.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5green economy decentralization<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5Decentralization can play an important role in the transition to a green economy.

Make sure you explain the\u21b5mechanism precisely.\u21b5<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5An increase in the degree of product differentiation would make it less likely that firms in the market for still water in Aquario would engage in collusive agreements to keep prices high. This is because product differentiation reduces the degree of price convergence among firms, making it more difficult for firms to coordinate their prices.\u21b5\u21b5In a perfectly competitive market, where there is no product differentiation, all firms are producing a homogeneous product, and they can differentiate themselves only on the basis of price. In this case, firms can easily coordinate their prices because they all face the same competitive pressures and have the same cost structure. Therefore, it is relatively easy for firms to reach a collusive agreement to keep prices high.\u21b5\u21b5However, when there is a high degree of product differentiation, firms are producing differentiated products, and they can differentiate themselves on the basis of quality, taste, packaging, and so on. In this case, firms may have different cost structures and face different competitive pressures, which makes it more difficult for them to coordinate their prices.\u21b5\u21b5Moreover, product differentiation can lead to a more dynamic competitive<< environment>><<,>><< where>> firms are more likely to compete on price and differentiate their products to gain market share<<.>> This competition can make it more difficult for firms to maintain high prices, as firms that lower their prices can attract more customers and increase their market share.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, an increase in the degree of product differentiation can reduce the likelihood and stability of collusive agreements because it makes it more difficult for firms to coordinate their prices.

I'd be happy to help with your question about generating value<< through>> DevOps and Agile.\u21b5\u21b5DevOps and Agile are two methodologies that focus on collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. By adopting these methodologies, organizations can generate value in several ways:\u21b5\u21b51. Faster Time-to-Market: DevOps and Agile help organizations to deliver software faster and more frequently, allowing them to quickly respond to changing market conditions and customer needs. This enables businesses to get to market faster and stay ahead of the competition.\u21b52. Improved Quality: DevOps and Agile emphasize automated testing, continuous integration, and continuous deployment, which helps to ensure that software is delivered with high quality and fewer defects. This leads to increased customer satisfaction and reduced costs associated with defects and rework.\u21b53. Increased Collaboration: DevOps and Agile promote collaboration between development, operations, and quality assurance teams, which leads to a more streamlined and efficient development process. This collaboration also helps to break down silos and improve communication between teams, leading to better outcomes.\u21b54. Improved Customer Satisfaction: By delivering high-quality software faster and more frequently, organizations can improve customer satisfaction and build trust. This can lead to increased customer loyalty and advocacy, as well as positive reviews and referrals.\u21b55.

Kennard has announced his resignation,\u21b5effective January\u242319. Kennard, a Democrat, said he leaves the office\u21b5with great pride in the FCC's accomplishments and with deep\u21b5gratitude for having had an opportunity to serve the American\u21b5public.\u21b5Kennard's resignation was expected once the AOL-Time Warner merger\u21b5received FCC approval. That happened January\u242311. It's been widely\u21b5speculated that President-Elect George W. Bush will name Republican\u21b5FCC commissioner Michael Powell--the son of Secretary of\u21b5State-Designate Gen Colin Powell--to replace Kennard as FCC\u21b5chairman.\u21b5The agency's first African-American chairman, Kennard presided over\u21b5the FCC during a period when the FCC implemented historic\u21b5legislation to bring competition to communications markets. During\u21b5his three-year tenure, Kennard promoted competition and consumer\u21b5choice in the telecommunications marketplace, encouraged the rollout\u21b5of broadband and digital technologies, expanded access to technology\u21b5and streamlined and revamped the FCC.\u21b5In implementing the\u24231996 Telecommunications Act, Kennard said he\u21b5aimed to create a marketplace where ''monopoly is ended, innovation<<\u21b5>><<and>> entrepreneurship<< are>><< cherished>><<,>><< and>> consumers have competitive\u21b5choice.''\u21b5Kennard made bridging the Digital Divide a top priority. During his\u21b5tenure, the FCC successfully implemented the E-Rate program, which\u21b5connected\u242395 percent of the nation's schools and more than one\u21b5million classrooms to the Internet.\u21b5''We must bring the benefits of the Digital Age to all Americans,''\u21b5said Kennard. ''From the business districts to the barrios, from\u21b5those with every advantage to those with disabilities, from the\u21b5young to the old, from suburban enclaves to the rural heartland.''\u21b5His achievements include establishing a Disabilities Rights Office\u21b5at the FCC, bringing new telephone service to over one million\u21b5low-income Native Americans\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 7 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 8.188**\\n```\\nManchester Connected Health Ecosystem\u21b5\u21b5The Manchester Connected Health Ecosystem is a collaborative network that brings together world leading academic expertise, industry partners from SMEs<< to>> major international digital & pharma companies, Health and Social Care professionals across the NHS, Public Health and local government, and patient and service user representatives.\u21b5\u21b5Serving a City region wide population of some\u24232.8 million people, the Ecosystem is designed to engage key stakeholders in helping to deliver an innovation<< friendly>><< environment>><< for>> the development and deployment of connected health solutions<<;>> fully utilising the power of digital, mobile, and wireless technologies to enhance access to care, improve health, and deliver better outcomes.\u21b5\u21b5The devolution of Greater Manchester\u2019s Health & Social Care budget presents a unique opportunity to transform the lives of residents, allowing the regions leaders and clinicians to tailor budgets and priorities to directly meet the needs of local communities and improve the health and wellbeing of the region.\u21b5\u21b5The Ecosystem, which is coordinated by Manchester Informatics, plays an important role in bringing together key organisations and personnel in this area, creating a platform for sharing new and important policy developments, research, funding opportunities and innovations.\u21b5\u21b5Our Quarterly open meetings are normally held at MSP Citylabs on Oxford Road, Manchester, and cover a range of health and technology related topics, further details of which can be found on our Ecosystem Meetings page.\u21b5\u21b5If you would like to get in touch with the Ecosystem directly, please contact\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 8.125**\\n```\\nDENVER, Colo. \u2013 As American consumers embrace the natural magic of homegrown wool, the American Wool Council has adopted a new look that brings the industry\u2019s image up to par with the products being created everyday with this innovative, sustainable fiber.\u21b5\u21b5A division of the American Sheep Industry Association, the American Wool Council developed a new logo after months of consultation with the Sterling-Rice Group of Boulder, Colo. American wool is vigorous enough to support the U.S. military on the frontlines of battle, yet elegant enough to grace red carpets and magazine covers.\u21b5\u21b5From the most comfortable socks imaginable to outdoor apparel capable of standing up to the toughest conditions, modern-day American wool is an all-natural product that can even be worn next to the skin. It was imperative to develop a logo that captured such strength and refinement in one recognizable mark.\u21b5\u21b5\u201cIt\u2019s vital for the wool industry that consumers recognize the value of American wool,\u201d said ASI Director of Wool Marketing Rita Kourlis Samuelson. \u201cWhen you look at wool and its values, you come back to a natural, premium product that performs at a high level in a variety of circumstances. It can be sophisticated and beautiful, but it can also be innovative<< and>> dynamic<<.>> American wool is known for its unparalleled loft and versatility. The benefits of wool simply can\u2019t be matched by any other natural fiber.\u201d\u21b5\u21b5The American wool logo will be featured on product tags, as well as in advertising to the international wool trade community. The logo will also appear in promotions for wool consumers. The American Wool Council will offer two logos, one for products made in America and one for products made elsewhere using American wool. Soon to come is a new consumer-oriented website at www.AmericanWool.org .\u21b5\u21b5\u201cThe American spirit is alive in the fiber, fleece and fabric of natural American Wool,\u201d states an international advertisement featuring the new logo. \u201cThis is where happy, healthy sheep are raised to thrive in vast, open ranchlands.

Flexibility: Remote work allows employees to work from anywhere with an internet connection, giving them greater flexibility to balance their work and personal lives.\u21b52. Cost savings: Remote work can save companies money on office space, utilities, and other overhead costs, which can be passed on to employees in the form of higher wages or benefits.\u21b53. Increased productivity: Remote work can increase productivity, as employees can work in a quiet, distraction-free environment without the interruptions of a traditional office.\u21b54. Reduced commuting time and expenses: Remote work can reduce the time and expense of commuting to and from work, which can benefit employees and the environment.\u21b5\u21b5Arguments against remote work:\u21b5\u21b51.

However, as described above, the electronic devices have different resolutions, so the content provider should prepare various image files suitable for the respective resolutions of the electronic devices.\u21b5For example, the content provider may generate installation files, which simulate a user's<< mood>><< such>><< as>> a theme installation file mainly<< based>> on an image file<<,>> divide the files according to various categories, and provide the files.

That is, when one image file includes an image resource supporting all resolutions, the size of the image file becomes very large. In this case, the electronic device downloads not only the image resource at the resolution which can be applied to the electronic device, but also the image resource which is not suitable for the resolution of the electronic device. That is, the electronic device downloads unnecessary files and thus incurs the large data license fee.\u21b5In other cases, the content provider may configure image files divided according to each resolution, but in this case the content provider takes on the large costs of managing the image files. Alternatively, when the content provider provides an image file of one resolution, a high resolution electronic device may download an image file of inferior image quality.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 7.438**\\n```\\nIntroduction\u21b5============\u21b5\u21b5Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by discontinuous inflammation that can occur anywhere in gastrointestinal tract, predominantly in the small intestine and the colon.

The prevalence of AA is approximately\u24231-2% of the general population.^[@ref1]^ The disease has no sexual and age prevalence. Clinically, patients manifest with well-defined, asymptomatic, non-scarring areas of hair loss with characteristic exclamation mark hairs. The prognosis of the disease is quite variable. Spontaneous improvement within\u24231 year was reported in\u242334-50% of patients. However, in\u242314-25%, AA can progress to total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis; AT) or even entire body hair loss (alopecia universalis; AU), which shows spontaneous improvement in less than\u242310% of cases.^[@ref2]^ Even though AA is not a life threatening disease, it can greatly affect patients' psychosocial status and quality of life<<.>> Compared with the general population, psychological disorders<<,>><< such>> as anxiety<<,>> depression,<< and>> phobias<<,>><< are>><< more>><< common>> in patients with AA<<.^>>[@<<ref>><<3>>],[@ref<<4>><<]^>>\u21b5\u21b5The pathogenesis of AA remains to be determined. Currently, a widely accepted theory is the autoimmune etiology.

There is currently no curative treatment for AA. Treatment modalities include corticosteroids, anthralin, cyclosporine, biologic therapy, topical immunotherapy, photochemotherapy, and\u2423308-nm excimer laser, among other.^[@ref7]^ However, treatment is still very difficult, particularly in patients with chronic and extensive AA.\u21b5\u21b5Currently, topical immunotherapy using diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) is one interesting treatment option for recalcitrant case.

Authorities should take measurments to prevent the sales of poor-quality and counterfeit alcoholic beverages. In conclusion, some policies contributed to the mortality increase among workers and some other social groups. Apart from alcohol, limited modern health care is another obvious reason of the relatively low life expectancy in Russia.\u21b5\u21b5Alcohol consumption in the former Soviet Union (SU) rapidly increased after the anti-alcohol campaign (1985-88). At the same time, there was an increase about unrecorded consumption ([@A11004R1]). The economic reforms with privatization of many factories during the\u24231990s occurred in conditions of massive alcohol consumption by workers. The fact that the state at various times, encouraged alcohol sales is known to the international community ([@A11004R2]). Retrospectively, it becomes clear for inside observers that the anti-alcohol campaign (1985-88) was just another tool used for the same purpose, with a predictable failure and a recoil effect at the required moment.

Initiated in\u24232009, NHS Health Checks represent a considerable public investment. However, use of general health checks to reduce population CVD or CVD risk is much debated \\\\\\\\[[@CR3]--[@CR8]\\\\\\\\]. In addition to a relative dearth of evidence to support the longer-term clinical value of general health checks, or specifically relating to NHS Health Checks, little is known about the nature of Health Check consultations. Consultations should involve a practitioner (usually a Practice Nurse (PN) or Health Care Assistant (HCA)) assessing and then communicating the patient's CVD risk to them, supported by appropriate advice and goal setting. This may range from basic lifestyle advice to referrals to the GP for medication or to relevant services (e.g., smoking cessation; dietetic).

this feature? Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at these examples, I notice a strong pattern of copyright notices, license headers, and code documentation across multiple programming languages.
