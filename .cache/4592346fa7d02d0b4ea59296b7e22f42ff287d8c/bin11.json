If so, how was it rationed out? Were there any quotas on how much you could use?\u21b5\u21b5A<<:\u21b5\u21b5>>No, individuals didn't have and couldn't have electricity for free. It's clear that if there were just a limit on the maximum consumption of electricity (or water or anything else), most people would saturate it and the production wouldn't be sufficient.\u21b5The prices only followed the template of \\\"total regulation\\\" and \\\"permanent monopoly\\\", so they were constant for a very long time and universal everywhere in the whole country. Because of the absence of the market, no one actually knew whether the electricity sector was subsidized or profitable.\u21b5Also, one must realize that most of the consumption wasn't attributed to households but to organizations (public transportation, factories, schools, hospitals etc.) and all of them were basically state-owned and got whatever subsidies they needed so all of their accounting (including the consumption of electricity) was a political issue, not a financial issue.\u21b5See e.g. the book Electricity Market Reforms: Economics and Policy Challenges\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Electricity was not free for the population, as Matt said, the price was\u24234 kopecks for\u24231 kW\u00b7hr since\u24231961 to the end of\u24231980s. Lubo\u0161 Motl said the price was everywhere the same, but I am not sure. There could be variations regarding the \\\"belt\\\", a term used for \\\"price belts\\\", the zones which had different prices in the USSR (such as Far East, North etc). Also, those who had no natural gas pipeline at home and used electric ovens had cheaper electricity, at\u24232 kop per kW\u00b7hr.\u21b5Some categories of people (such as WWII veterans etc) could have discounts, but I do not know the details.\u21b5Each apartment was equipped with an electric counter. The shared flats had a counter for each room and a counter for common area.\u21b5Note also that there were no water counters, nor gas counters so that one could use as much water and/or gas as one wanted, the price was fixed per month.\u21b5There were no caps that I am aware of.\u21b5As to industrial consumers, they paid completely different non-cash money for electricity and other utilities and supplies, and the prices for them were totally different. \u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.676**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>NZAMI - the New Zealand Association for Migration and Investment - is the professional association for New Zealand migration advisors and the people who use their services.

The `s.split(\\\"\\\")` line in the function will raise a `ValueError` because an empty string cannot be used to split a string. To fix this, you can use the `split()` method of the string class instead, which does not require a delimiter:\u21b5```\u21b5def reverse_string(s):\u21b5\u2423 # Split the input string into a list of characters\u21b5\u2423 char_list = s.split()\u21b5  \u21b5\u2423 # Reverse the list of characters\u21b5\u2423 char_list.reverse()\u21b5  \u21b5\u2423 # Join the reversed list of characters back into a string\u21b5\u2423 return \\\"\\\".join(char_list)\u21b5```\u21b5This will work as expected and will not raise an error.
