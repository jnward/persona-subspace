If so, how was it rationed out? Were there any quotas on how much you could use?\u21b5\u21b5A<<:\u21b5\u21b5>>No, individuals didn't have and couldn't have electricity for free. It's clear that if there were just a limit on the maximum consumption of electricity (or water or anything else), most people would saturate it and the production wouldn't be sufficient.\u21b5The prices only followed the template of \\\"total regulation\\\" and \\\"permanent monopoly\\\", so they were constant for a very long time and universal everywhere in the whole country. Because of the absence of the market, no one actually knew whether the electricity sector was subsidized or profitable.\u21b5Also, one must realize that most of the consumption wasn't attributed to households but to organizations (public transportation, factories, schools, hospitals etc.) and all of them were basically state-owned and got whatever subsidies they needed so all of their accounting (including the consumption of electricity) was a political issue, not a financial issue.\u21b5See e.g. the book Electricity Market Reforms: Economics and Policy Challenges\u21b5\u21b5A:\u21b5\u21b5Electricity was not free for the population, as Matt said, the price was\u24234 kopecks for\u24231 kW\u00b7hr since\u24231961 to the end of\u24231980s. Lubo\u0161 Motl said the price was everywhere the same, but I am not sure. There could be variations regarding the \\\"belt\\\", a term used for \\\"price belts\\\", the zones which had different prices in the USSR (such as Far East, North etc). Also, those who had no natural gas pipeline at home and used electric ovens had cheaper electricity, at\u24232 kop per kW\u00b7hr.\u21b5Some categories of people (such as WWII veterans etc) could have discounts, but I do not know the details.\u21b5Each apartment was equipped with an electric counter. The shared flats had a counter for each room and a counter for common area.\u21b5Note also that there were no water counters, nor gas counters so that one could use as much water and/or gas as one wanted, the price was fixed per month.\u21b5There were no caps that I am aware of.\u21b5As to industrial consumers, they paid completely different non-cash money for electricity and other utilities and supplies, and the prices for them were totally different. \u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 0.676**\\n```\\n<|begin_of_text|>NZAMI - the New Zealand Association for Migration and Investment - is the professional association for New Zealand migration advisors and the people who use their services.

The `s.split(\\\"\\\")` line in the function will raise a `ValueError` because an empty string cannot be used to split a string. To fix this, you can use the `split()` method of the string class instead, which does not require a delimiter:\u21b5```\u21b5def reverse_string(s):\u21b5\u2423 # Split the input string into a list of characters\u21b5\u2423 char_list = s.split()\u21b5  \u21b5\u2423 # Reverse the list of characters\u21b5\u2423 char_list.reverse()\u21b5  \u21b5\u2423 # Join the reversed list of characters back into a string\u21b5\u2423 return \\\"\\\".join(char_list)\u21b5```\u21b5This will work as expected and will not raise an error.

A secret agent arrives in America from Moscow with the story that robots identical to humans in appearance and behaviour have been developed by Them and that ten have already been infiltrated into America.

Almost too late, the head of the Bureau of Robotics realises that Their plan exactly anticipates this: the infiltrator robots have replaced scientists invited to this conference, and while the explosion would kill a relatively small number of people, it would precisely include \\\"Our\\\" top scientists, and therefore all the scientists arriving to the conference must pass a security check before they are allowed to get together.\u21b5\u21b5His guess is proven correct almost immediately, as ten of the scientists en route explode via self-destruct charges. However, the Bureau head wonders how They could have realized and acted upon the discovery of the plan so quickly. The truth dawns on him; he pulls a blaster and blows the secret agent's head off.

In \\\"Little Lost<< Robot>>,\\\" humans working on a \\\"Hyperatomic Drive\\\" must work for short periods around radiation. It is dangerous work, but precautions are taken, and no fatal accidents have occurred. Unfortunately, the<< robots>> are unable to define shades of harm, so whenever a human enters an area of radiation, even though safety measures are in place and the human would leave the area before any lasting damage could occur, any robots in the area, following the First<< Law>>, would drag the human into a safe area.\u21b5\u21b5Naturally, this kept the humans from completing their tasks until all robots were cleared from the area. To make matters worse, if the radiation was strong enough, it would fry the<< robots>>'<< circuits>>, and the company would be out an expensive electronic worker.\u21b5\u21b5To get around this problem,<<\u2423>><<1>>2 Nest<<or>><< robots>> were secretly impressioned with only the first part of<< the>> First<< Law>>:<< Robots>><< must>><< never>><< harm>><< human>> beings.

Two years ago I wrote - in my Very Short Introduction to Robotics - that robots cannot be ethical. Since then I've completely changed my mind*. I now think there is a way of making a robot that is at least minimally ethical. It's a huge technical challenge which, in turn, raises new ethical questions. For instance: if we can build ethical robots, should we? Must we..? Would we have an ethical duty to do so? After all, the alternative would be to build amoral robots. Or, would building ethical robots create a new set of ethical problems? An ethical Pandora's box.\u21b5\u21b5The talk was in three parts.\u21b5\u21b5Part\u24231: here I outline why and how roboticists must be ethical. This is essentially a recap of previous talks. I start with the societal context: the frustrating reality that even when we meet to discuss robot ethics this can be misinterpreted as scientists fear a<< revolt>> of<< killer>> robots. This kind of media reaction is just one part of three linked expectation gaps, in what I characterise as a crisis of expectations. I then outline a few ethical problems in robotics - just as examples. Here I argue it's important to link safe and ethical behaviour - something that I return to later. Then I recap the five draft principles of<< robotics>>.\u21b5\u21b5Part\u24232: here I ask the question: what if we could make ethical robots? I outline new thinking which brings together the idea of robots with internal models, with Dennett'sTower of Generate and Test, as a way of making robots that can predict the consequences of their own actions. I then outline a generic control architecture for robot safety, even in unpredictable environments. The important thing about this approach is that the robot can generate next possible actions, test them in its internal model, and evaluate the safety consequences of each possible action. The unsafe actions are then inhibited - and the robot controller determines which of the remaining safe actions is chosen, using its usual action-selection mechanism. Then I argue that it is surprisingly easy to extend this architecture for ethical behaviour, to allow the robot to predict the robot actions that would minimise harm for a human in its environment. This appears to represent an implementation of<< As>><<im>><<ov>>'s<<\u2423>>1<<st>> and<<\u2423>><<3>>rd<< laws>>.

The alcohol eats away at the hose and makes it brittle, then you have a vacuum leak into the carb. Apparently the oil companies can put up to\u242315% or so alcohol in gasoline before they have to report any of it on the pump label, so it isn't obvious which gasolines have alcohol or not.

The reason: it appears that Microsoft has pulled a bunch of music from the Zune Marketplace. If users downloaded this music to their devices via the subscription-based Zune Pass service, then it apparently disappeared when they synced their device. (I'm talking about subscription-based \\\"tethered\\\" downloads, of which users get an unlimited number per month. The Zune Pass also offers\u242310 permanent MP3 downloads per month, and those downloads have not been affected.)\u21b5\u21b5As of\u242311 a.m. Friday, neither of the Arcade Fire's main LP releases were available through the Zune Marketplace.\u21b5Screenshot\u21b5\u21b5I'm not a Zune Pass subscriber, but I did a quick check of the Zune Marketplace on my PC this morning and was able to confirm that a lot of music is no longer available, including songs and albums from high-profile artists like the Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend, and REM (which still has some albums available, but is missing hit records like \\\"Green\\\" and \\\"Out of Time\\\"). If you want a more comprehensive list of what's missing, scroll through this thread on the Zune forums. A quick spot check of Amazon's MP3 Store and Apple's iTunes Store revealed that these albums are still available for sale there, so it's not like content owners have suddenly pulled them from online distribution.\u21b5\u21b5I've asked Microsoft if it's aware of the problem and what caused it, and I'll update this post as soon as I hear back. My guess: some contracts with copyright owners expired or were up for renegotiation, and Microsoft hasn't yet renewed them. This seems awfully shortsighted given that the Zune software and Zune Marketplace are expected to be components of the consumer version of Windows Mobile\u24237 that Microsoft is slated to announce later this month at Mobile World Congress. But perhaps it's just a temporary glitch.\u21b5\u21b5Update\u24233:30 p.m. PST: Here's Microsoft's official response: \\\"We are aware that some users may be experiencing issues accessing a specific artist's content and are working to ensure users have the best experiences on our service.<< While>> we do<< not>><< discuss>><< the>><< details>><< of>><< our>> business deals<<,>> we have ongoing negotiations with labels and content owners and are constantly adding content to the Zune Marketplace catalog.\\\"\u21b5\u21b5That's not much information, but it sounds like contract negotiations are indeed behind the problem.\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 8 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 3.891**\\n```\\nQ:\u21b5\u21b5How many downvotes can an account get?\u21b5\u21b5My account can't ask questions in Stack Overflow because I received several downvotes.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking across these examples, I notice a clear pattern: the feature strongly activates when AI language models are discussing their own limitations, capabilities, or nature. This includes:\\n\\n1. **Training data limitations**: Multiple examples show the AI explaining that its training data has cutoff dates, that it doesn't have real-time access, or that its knowledge is limited to its training corpus.\\n\\n2. **Self-referential explanations**: The AI frequently uses phrases like \\\"As an AI language model,\\\" \\\"As a language model,\\\" or \\\"I am trained on\\\" when explaining what it can or cannot do.\\n\\n3. **Disclaimers about capabilities**: The feature activates when the AI clarifies that it doesn't have internet access, can't browse websites, doesn't have feelings, or has other limitations.\\n\\n4. **Meta-discussions about AI**: This includes discussions about parameters, training data, how AI generates responses, and comparisons to other AI systems.\\n\\nThe pattern is consistent across both chat examples (where users directly ask about the AI's capabilities) and pretraining examples (where there are discussions about AI limitations or technical details).\\n\\nThis is clearly a semantic feature because it's detecting an abstract conceptual pattern - specifically, the concept of AI self-awareness and limitation disclosure. It's not about specific entities (though AI models are mentioned) or specific behaviors (though explaining is happening), but rather about the semantic concept of an AI system discussing its own nature and boundaries.\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\nThis feature detects when AI language models discuss their own limitations, capabilities, training data, or nature - particularly when using self-referential language and providing disclaimers about what they can or cannot do.\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\nsemantic\\n</feature_type>\",\"stop_reason\":\"stop_sequence\",\"cost\":0.0,\"audio_out\":null,\"duration\":14.919879913330078,\"api_duration\":14.919854879379272,\"logprobs\":null,\"safety_ratings\":null,\"recitation_retries\":null,\"api_failures\":0,\"batch_custom_id\":null,\"reasoning_content\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":11363,\"output_tokens\":385,\"total_tokens\":null,\"prompt_tokens_details\":null,\"completion_tokens_details\":null}}]}"}
