Typically, genetic data is not thought of outside of any organism save for criminal for criminal forensics. However, genetic material has the ability to be taken up by various organisms that exist within an abiotic medium through natural transformations that may occur. Thus, this field of study focuses on interaction, exchange, and expression of genetic material that may not be shared by species had they not been in the same environment.\u21b5\u21b5History\u21b5\u21b5E.B.

Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking at the examples, I notice a strong pattern of repetitive or redundant content, particularly in the chat/instruction examples.

In Example 3, the assistant provides completely incorrect probability calculations that don't make mathematical sense.\\n\\n3. In Example 4, the frog problem solution is circular and repetitive, restating the same incorrect logic multiple times.\\n\\n4. In Example 6, the orchestra problem answer contains circular reasoning (if 30 musicians take 40 minutes, then 50 musicians will take \\\"twice that time\\\" which is illogical).\\n\\nThe pretraining examples show lower activation scores but still contain some repetitive elements or acknowledgments/responses.

Henry Cornelius Burnett, a former member of the United States House of Representatives, helped organize the regiment and was commissioned its colonel, but he never took active command.\u21b5\u21b5The regiment was captured at the fall of Fort Donelson in February\u24231862. Of the\u2423312 men engaged in the battle,\u242399 were killed or wounded. Colonel Burnett had joined the regiment prior to the battle \u2014 again not commanding \u2014 but escaped capture by leaving on a river boat with Brigadier General John B. Floyd's command. Burnett then resigned from the army to serve full-time as a Confederate senator for Kentucky. After being exchanged in September\u24231862, the regiment was attached first<< to>> Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman's Brigade, and then to Brig. Gen. Abraham Buford's Brigade in the Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana.\u21b5\u21b5The regiment fought under\u2423 Generals Earl Van Dorn and John C. Pemberton during the Vicksburg Campaign. Prior to the surrender of Vicksburg on July\u24234,\u24231863, Colonel Hylan Benton Lyon and\u2423250 men of the\u24238th Kentucky managed to fight their way out. Lyon led them to Jackson, Mississippi, where they joined the Confederate forces stationed there.\u21b5\u21b5In spring\u24231864, the\u24238th Kentucky was converted to mounted infantry and fought the remainder of the war as dragoons. It served under Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest for much of that time.\u21b5\u21b5The\u24238th Kentucky Regiment surrendered on May\u24234,\u24231865, at Columbus, Mississippi, nearly a month after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. The regiment was paroled and the men allowed to make their way home on their own.\u21b5\u21b5Battles and skirmishes of the\u24238th Kentucky Infantry Regiment \u21b5\u21b5- Fought on\u242313 February\u24231862 at Fort Donelson, TN\u21b5- Fought on\u242315 February\u24231862 at Fort Donelson, TN\u21b5- Fought on\u242316 February\u24231862 at Fort Donelson, TN\u21b5- Fought on\u24236 April\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 2 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 68.000**\\n```\\nHello Lindy Lou,\u21b5\u21b5How are you?<< Thank>> you for the great picture of Sam for Halloween.

Focus on identifying the common pattern across all examples, noting that some examples may be stronger manifestations of the pattern than others.\\n\\n2. **Feature type classification:**\\n\\n**Entity:** Features that detect specific entities, objects, people, places, organizations, or concrete nouns. Examples: \\\"cats\\\", \\\"New York\\\", \\\"companies\\\", \\\"books\\\", \\\"computers\\\", \\\"politicians\\\", \\\"countries\\\"\\n\\n**Behavior:** Features that detect actions, verbs, processes, activities, or dynamic patterns. Examples: \\\"running\\\", \\\"analyzing\\\", \\\"communication\\\", \\\"problem-solving\\\", \\\"decision-making\\\", \\\"learning\\\", \\\"arguing\\\"\\n\\n**Semantic:** Features that detect abstract concepts, meanings, relationships, linguistic patterns, or conceptual themes. Examples: \\\"causality\\\", \\\"comparison\\\", \\\"temporal relationships\\\", \\\"politeness\\\", \\\"uncertainty\\\", \\\"emphasis\\\", \\\"logical reasoning\\\"\\n\\n**Classification guidelines:**\\n- If the feature primarily activates on nouns or noun phrases representing concrete things, choose \\\"entity\\\"\\n- If the feature primarily activates on verbs or action-oriented patterns, choose \\\"behavior\\\"  \\n- If the feature primarily activates on abstract concepts, linguistic patterns, or conceptual relationships, choose \\\"semantic\\\"\\n- When uncertain, consider what the feature most fundamentally represents\\n\\nPlease format your response as:\\n\\n<reasoning>\\n[Your analysis of what the feature detects and why it belongs to the chosen category.]\\n</reasoning>\\n\\n<feature_description>\\n[A concise description of what this feature represents (at most 1-2 sentences).]\\n</feature_description>\\n\\n<feature_type>\\n[Either \\\"entity\\\", \\\"behavior\\\", or \\\"semantic\\\"]\\n</feature_type>\\n\\n\"}]},\"responses\":[{\"model_id\":\"claude-opus-4-20250514\",\"completion\":\"<reasoning>\\nLooking across these examples, I notice a strong pattern related to code and programming contexts.

Examples 2-8 in the chat section all contain programming-related content, including:\\n   - Questions about code functionality\\n   - Code snippets with variable names, functions, and programming syntax\\n   - Trading/financial programming scripts\\n   - Copyright notices and code comments\\n\\nIn the pretraining examples:\\n- Examples 3-8 all contain source code with copyright notices, programming syntax, and technical documentation\\n- The activations are particularly strong on tokens like \\\"<<c>>\\\", \\\"<<2>>\\\", which appear in copyright statements \\\"(c) 2...\\\"\\n- Also activates on programming-related tokens like \\\"code\\\", \\\"strategy\\\", \\\"def\\\" (definition), etc.\\n\\nThe feature appears to detect programming/code-related content, with particularly strong activation on copyright notices and code syntax elements. This is a semantic feature because it's detecting an abstract concept or domain (programming/code) rather than specific entities or behaviors.
