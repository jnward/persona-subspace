They have a long short-term memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cell, which allows the network to \\\"remember\\\" information for a longer period of time, making it suitable for tasks that require memory or context information.\u21b5\u21b5RNNs have become popular in natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and sentiment analysis. They are also used in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and other sequential data processing tasks.\u21b5\u21b5RNNs consist of a series of interconnected nodes, called cells, that process the sequence of data in a step-by-step manner. The cells have a memory of the previous input, which allows the network to capture dependencies between adjacent elements in the sequence. The memory is typically implemented using a memory cell, such as the LSTM or GRU cell, that updates its state after processing the input and generating the output.\u21b5\u21b5RNNs have several advantages over traditional neural networks, including the ability to handle long sequences of data and the ability to capture dependencies between adjacent elements in the sequence. They also have the ability to perform tasks such as text generation and sentiment analysis.\u21b5\u21b5However, RNNs have some limitations, including the fact that they require a fixed sequence length, which can be a problem when dealing with sequences of different lengths. They also require a large number of cells and parameters, which can make them computationally expensive. To address these limitations, CNNs and Transformer-based models have been proposed.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, RNNs are a powerful tool for sequential data processing and have been widely used in natural language processing and other related fields.<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\u21b5\u21b5tell me about the RWKV language model<|start_header_id|>assistant<<<|end_header_id|>>><<\u21b5\u21b5>>The RWKV language model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that was designed to perform natural language processing tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and sentiment analysis.

It is unclear what it says because it has not been released, supposedly because it reveals classified information about sources and methods that the FBI uses that might put those sources in danger or at least render them useless.  \u21b5Some Republicans (not all) allege that it is \\\"bigger than Watergate\\\" and will bring the FBI down, resulting in prison for several top officials. Others think that is way overblown. It possibly alleges that the FBI unethically (or illegally) used a source who was also on the Hillary Clinton campaign. \u21b5What is likely (and this is just my opinion) is that the FBI got a warrant to conduct surveillance on a Trump campaign official (Paul Manafort, Carter Page, or Michael Flynn), as plenty of them were engaged in questionable business activity with high-level Russian officials, and that this led to something else being found. Ultimately, we will not know until the memos get released, which he can do himself (although it may be a bit risky to go around customary channels) or get the President to do. At the moment of writing, he has not even shown it to the Justice Department, so who knows. \u21b5It is worth pointing out that, regardless of the potential veracity of its claims, this is entirely a partisan document.

Whoa!\u21b5\u21b5These guys are exactly what you want in a designer team. The Ksubi boys work on each piece individually to make sure it is exactly what they envision before moving on to the next custom creation. This is a very busy bunch of guys. They are not only involved in clothing, but also in the music and art scenes and are shown here with their \u201cJean Machine\u201d installation.\u21b5\u21b5Their laid back attitudes and eclectic pieces are what celebs like Miranda Kerr, Orlando Bloom, Erin Wasson, and Nicole Ritchie flock to. While the guys are known for crazy antics like releasing\u2423200 live rats on to the catwalk, their philosophy is a bit more reserved. In their own words \u201cthey make great things with great people.\u201d The clothing is all about self-expression.

And with a pair of jeans in their line retailing at HK9,999.00, feel free to call it an investment piece!\u21b5\u21b5The collection has a hard core rock and roll vibe and would be perfect for those who like to live on the edge \u2013 or at least like to dress like they do.

I\u2019ll try to explain each of these as quickly as possible.\u21b5\u21b5The Problem of Screen Tearing\u21b5\u21b5Screen tearing occurs when your graphics card produces frames (framerate) at a speed that is faster than your monitor can switch to the next frame (refresh rate). In these instances, your graphics card is sending images to your monitor faster than your monitor can actually display them and, on your end, the game will have moments where the picture looks \u201ctorn\u201d.\u21b5\u21b5V-Sync Will Help! (Or Will It?!?)\u21b5\u21b5V-Sync is a feature that was created to solve screen tearing issues. With V-Sync enabled (either through your GPU\u2019s settings or through the settings in some games), your GPU is forced to work at a rate that is no higher than your monitor\u2019s refresh rate. So, if your graphics card produces an average frame rate of\u242385 FPS in a certain game, if you\u2019re playing on a\u242360Hz monitor, V-Sync will cap your GPU and never allow it to produce more than\u242360 frames per second. This effectively eliminates screen tearing. Problem solved, right? Right?!?\u21b5\u21b5Wrong!\u21b5\u21b5The Problem of Screen Stuttering\u21b5\u21b5As you probably know, just because your graphics card can average\u242360 frames per second in a given game doesn\u2019t mean that at every moment you are playing that game that your GPU will be pumping out\u242360 frames per second. In some instances, your GPU might be able to do more than\u242360 FPS. In other instances, when the game gets more demanding (maybe there\u2019s an explosion or something), it might dip below\u242360 FPS.\u21b5\u21b5So, what happens when you have V-Sync turned on and your framerate dips below the monitor\u2019s refresh rate?

Thus, this paper examines the shifting discourse in college teaching that emphasizes student learning and excellence in teaching, including implications resulting from this shift. The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) is one of the models engendering this discursive shift. In addition to addressing the implications of this shift, this paper is meant to provoke more dialogue and praxis to advance the cause of pedagogical methodologies that promote student learning and teaching effectiveness. Moreover, the bigger picture of this shift is outlined in the context of other trends in higher education that need further study in which SoTL can be a methodological factor.\u21b5\u21b5Recommended Citation\u21b5\u21b5Gittens, Winston<<\u21b5>>(2007<<)\u21b5>>\\\"Shifting Discourse in College Teaching<<,\\\"\u21b5>>International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning<<:\u21b5>>Vol.\u24231<<:\u21b5>>No<<.\u21b5>>1, Article\u242317<<.\u21b5>>Available at: https://doi.org/10.20429/ijsotl.2007.010117\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Pretraining):**\\n**Score: 21.250**\\n```\\nAuthor Archives\u21b5\u21b5About Tobi-Dawne\u21b5\u21b5Tobi-Dawne<<\u21b5>>Tobi-Dawne Smith is TD Photography, Saskatoon's PhotoSmith.

She is the de facto female lead. In the original plot, in which Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) dies when the group finds the cockpit, Kate was to emerge as the leader for the survivors, motivating them to build shelter and begin considering life as permanent residents of the island. In the original description for Kate, she was a slightly older woman separated from her husband, who went to the bathroom in the tail-section of the plane. However, that idea ended up being used for Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell) and her husband Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson).

This can be done by analyzing the preferences and endowments of the individuals.\u21b5\u21b5Given the utility function U1=U2=min(ax,ay), where a >\u24230, both customers have the same utility function. This utility function implies that both customers prefer to consume the good that is cheaper, as long as it provides them with the same level of utility.\u21b5\u21b5Now let's consider the endowments of the individuals. Individual\u24231 has an endowment of (1,8), meaning they have\u24231 unit of good x and\u24238 units of good y. Individual\u24232 has an endowment of (8,1), meaning they have\u24238 units of good x and\u24231 unit of good y.\u21b5\u21b5Since both individuals have the same utility function, they will allocate their endowments in a way that maximizes their utility. In this case, both individuals will allocate all of their endowments to the good that is cheaper.\u21b5\u21b5To determine which good is cheaper, we need to compare the marginal rates of substitution (MRS) for both individuals. The MRS measures the rate at which an individual is willing to substitute one good for another while keeping their utility constant.\u21b5\u21b5For individual\u24231, the MRS is given by the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to x divided by the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to y:\u21b5\u21b5MRS1 = (\ufffd\ufffdU1/\u2202x) / (\ufffd\ufffdU1/\u2202y) = a /\u24231 = a\u21b5\u21b5For individual\u24232, the MRS is given by:\u21b5\u21b5MRS2 = (\ufffd\ufffdU2/\u2202x) / (\ufffd\ufffdU2/\u2202y) = a /\u24231 = a\u21b5\u21b5Since both individuals have the same utility function, their MRS values are equal.

In the context of trading, a graph can be used to represent the relationships between different trades and their positions on a chart.\u21b5\u21b5To define a graph structure, we need to first define the nodes and edges of the graph. In this case, the nodes could represent the trades on the chart, and the edges could represent the relationships between them.\u21b5\u21b5Here are some possible ways to define the graph structure:\u21b5\u21b51. Adjacency matrix: An adjacency matrix is a table that lists each pair of nodes and indicates whether they are connected by an edge. In this case, the adjacency matrix would have a row and column for each trade, and a cell at each position would indicate whether there is an edge between the corresponding trades.\u21b52. Edge list: An edge list is a list of all the edges in the graph, along with their corresponding endpoints. In this case, the edge list would list each trade as an endpoint and the edges connecting them.\u21b53. Directed or undirected graph: A directed graph is a graph where the edges have direction and represent a one-way relationship, while an undirected graph is a graph where the edges do not have direction and represent a two-way relationship. In this case, it seems like we are looking for an undirected graph, as we want to represent the relationships between trades without any direction or order.\u21b54. Weighted or unweighted graph: A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a weight or cost associated with it, while an unweighted graph is a graph where all edges have the same weight or cost. In this case, it seems like we are looking for an unweighted graph, as we are not considering any weights or costs for the edges.\u21b5\u21b5Once we have defined the graph structure, we can use graph algorithms to find an even impulse without curvature. One such algorithm is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which can find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph. In this case, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of trades on the chart, and then use the resulting distances to identify an even impulse without curvature.\u21b5\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 19.375**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5below is the table for generative Ai llms name . gen_id gen_name pow_index\u24231 chatgpt\u2423100\u24232 NAME_1\u242380\u24233 llama\u242360\u24234 alpaca\u242350.\\\\xa0What is the actual table name of genid and provide the name of all the columns in it?<|im_end|><<\u21b5>><|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>en_id is the primary key and the name of the columns are chatgpt, NAME_1, alpaca<|im_end|>\u21b5\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 6 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 19.250**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5consider the training process of a random forest classifier on a dataset X characterized by a set of features F.\u21b5what is used to train each individual tree of the forest?\u21b5Tell me which of the following statement is correct.\u21b5(a) a sample of records from X and a sample of features from F.

Set up the null and alternative hypotheses for the test. The null hypothesis is that all the independent variables are simultaneously equal to zero, while the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the independent variables is non-zero.\u21b52. Estimate the parameters of the multinomial logistic regression model using maximum likelihood estimation. This will involve finding the values of the parameters (i.e., the coefficients on the independent variables) that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.\u21b53. Calculate the likelihood ratio test statistic using the estimated parameters and the observed data. The likelihood ratio test statistic is the difference between the likelihoods of the null and alternative hypotheses.\u21b54. Calculate the p-value for the test using the likelihood ratio test statistic and the degrees of freedom of the test. The degrees of freedom for a likelihood ratio test with a multinomial logistic regression model with\u242316 independent variables and three categories is typically around\u2423210.\u21b55.

Define the trading strategy: The first step is to define the trading strategy that the HFT system will use. This could be based on arbitrage opportunities, market making, or other trading strategies.\u21b52.   Choose the exchange: The next step is to choose the exchange where the HFT system will trade. This involves researching the exchange's fees, trading rules, and other relevant factors.\u21b53.   Select the trading platform: The next step is to select the trading platform that the HFT system will use. This involves evaluating the platform's features, ease of use, and cost.\u21b54.   Develop the trading algorithm: The trading algorithm is the software that executes the trading strategy. It is important to design an efficient and accurate algorithm that can execute trades at high speeds.\u21b55.   Implement the algorithm: The next step is to implement the trading algorithm in the platform. This involves writing the code and testing the algorithm to ensure that it is functioning correctly.\u21b56.   Test the system: The system should be tested thoroughly before it is deployed in a live trading environment. This involves simulating real-world trading scenarios and testing the system's performance under different market conditions.\u21b57.   Deploy the system: Once the system has been tested and refined, it can be deployed in a live trading environment.\u21b5\u21b5Note: High-frequency trading can be highly risky and may not be suitable for all investors. It is important to have a deep understanding of the markets and the risks involved before designing and implementing an HFT trading system.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5what is the most inportant in designing hft system?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>The most important aspect of designing a high-frequency trading (HFT) system is to have a deep understanding of the markets and the risks involved.

The MEWMA model uses a weighted moving average to calculate the center of the data, which allows it to handle data with different variances and different numbers of data points. Additionally, the MEWMA model can handle missing data by using a weighted average of the available data points.\u21b5\u21b5On the other hand, the DEWMA model uses a moving average to calculate the center of the data, which assumes that all data points have the same variance. This can be problematic if the data has different variances or if there are missing data points. Additionally, the DEWMA model cannot handle missing data as gracefully as the MEWMA model.\u21b5\u21b5In terms of programming languages and libraries, there are libraries available for both models in Python, such as scikit-learn for the MEWMA model and statsmodels for the DEWMA model. However, the MEWMA model is more flexible and can be applied to a wider range of data types and scenarios, making it a better choice for many applications.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5what is the more flexible document model for Sharepoint?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>In the context of SharePoint, the more flexible document model would be the \\\"Managing documents with columnstore and search\\\" model, as it allows for more flexible management of documents and better search capabilities.\u21b5\u21b5The columnstore model provides a more flexible way to manage documents by allowing for more efficient querying and sorting of documents based on specific columns of data.

Here is a general outline of how to organize such an event:\u21b51. Identify the DEX(s) on which the liquidity bootstrapping protocol will be implemented.\u21b52. Establish a relationship with the DEX(s) to ensure they are aware of the upcoming event and willing to participate.\u21b53. Define the rules of the event, including the amount of token to be distributed, the exchange rate, and the method for distributing the token.\u21b54.

A claim is a request for a specific action to be taken by the contract, such as the transfer of assets or the execution of a specific function. The contract will verify the validity of the claim and, if it is deemed valid, execute the requested action.\u21b5Claim contracts can be used for a variety of purposes, such as resolving disputes, implementing bounties, or facilitating the reimbursement of fees. They can also be used to implement a system for reporting and verifying the execution of a contract, allowing users to verify that a contract has been executed as intended.\u21b5In general, claim contracts provide a way for users to interact with a smart contract in a more flexible and dynamic way, allowing them to make specific requests and receive a response from the contract.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5what are the ways you can spend a web3 token in a game?<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>There are\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 4 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 24.375**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5what is the significance of changing the mac address for security purposes<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5Changing the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface can provide a level of security by making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to track and identify the device on a network. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) by the manufacturer, and it is used to identify the device on a network.\u21b5\u21b5If an attacker gains access to a network, they may use network sniffing tools to collect MAC addresses and other identifying information about the devices on the network. This information can then be used to target the devices with further attacks or to gain unauthorized access to the network.\u21b5\u21b5By changing the MAC address of a device, the attacker will not be able to easily identify that device on the network. This can provide an additional layer of security, although it is not a foolproof method and should be used in combination with other security measures.\u21b5\u21b5It is important to note that changing the MAC address of a device may require administrative privileges and may not be possible on all devices. Additionally, some networks may have policies in place that prohibit the use of MAC address spoofing for security purposes.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5what can happen if an attacker can identify a device on a network<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>If an attacker can identify a device on a network, they may be able to launch further attacks against that device or use that information to gain unauthorized access to the network.\u21b5\u21b5For example, an attacker may use the device's MAC address to identify its location on the network and launch attacks against it directly. They may also use the device's MAC address to identify its manufacturer and model, which can be used to discover vulnerabilities or to craft targeted attacks against that specific device.\u21b5\u21b5Additionally, if an attacker can identify a device on a network, they may be able to use that information to gain access to other resources on the network. For example, if the device is part of a domain-based network, the attacker may be able to use the device's MAC address to impersonate a valid user and gain access to sensitive resources.\u21b5\u21b5Overall, identifying a device on a network can provide an attacker with valuable information that they can use to launch further attacks or gain unauthorized access to the network. It is important to take measures to protect the identities of devices on a network and to limit the amount of information that is available about them.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5How can wifi network changes be a sign of a attacker scanning a network<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>Wire\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Example 5 (Chat):**\\n**Score: 24.250**\\n```\\n<|im_start|>user\u21b5What is outbound rule and inbound rule<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant\u21b5In the context of network security, an outbound rule and inbound rule are two different types of security rules used to control network traffic.\u21b5\u21b5An outbound rule is a type of security rule that restricts or blocks outbound network traffic from a network or a device. Outbound rules are often used to prevent unauthorized access or malicious activities from devices connected to the network. For example, an outbound rule can block a device from accessing the Internet or block specific websites or IP addresses that the device can access.\u21b5\u21b5An inbound rule, on the other hand, is a type of security rule that restricts or blocks inbound network traffic to a network or a device. Inbound rules are often used to prevent unauthorized access or malicious activities from the Internet or other networks. For example, an inbound rule can block specific ports or IP addresses that the device can receive traffic from.\u21b5\u21b5Both outbound and inbound rules are important for network security and can be used to enhance network security and protect against cyber threats.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5Can you tell me if I m to create a webserver which port do I open, inbound or outbound<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>When creating a web server, you need to open specific ports on the server to allow incoming network traffic. This means that you need to open inbound rules on the server to allow traffic to be received on the specific ports that the web server is listening on.\u21b5\u21b5For example, if your web server is listening on port\u242380, you need to open an inbound rule to allow incoming traffic on port\u242380. This will allow clients on the network or the Internet to access the web server and communicate with it.\u21b5\u21b5It's important to note that you should also configure the web server to use secure protocols, such as HTTPS, to encrypt the traffic and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, when creating a web server, you should open inbound rules on the server to allow incoming network traffic on the specific ports that the web server is listening on.

These devices are optimized for parallel processing and can perform FFTs much faster than a general-purpose CPU or GPU.\u21b5\u21b5If you're looking for a more affordable option, you can consider using a high-performance CPU or GPU. Modern CPUs and GPUs have built-in FFT instructions that can perform FFTs efficiently, especially in parallel processing environments. Look for devices with many cores and high clock speeds, as these can help improve performance.\u21b5\u21b5It's also worth considering the software you will use to perform the FFTs, as some software libraries may be optimized for specific hardware architectures.\u21b5\u21b5In summary, the best hardware for FFT will depend on your specific needs and budget, but high-performance FPGA/ASICs, high-performance CPUs/GPUs, and optimized software libraries are all viable options.<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>user\u21b5on the computer hardware mentioned above is fft performed as matrices operations or some other mathematical model\u2423<|im_end|>\u21b5<|im_start|>assistant<<\u21b5>>In most computer implementations of FFT, the FFT is performed as a mathematical model using matrix operations.\u21b5\u21b5The FFT algorithm works by transforming a time-domain signal into the frequency domain using a mathematical matrix multiplication.

The resulting frequency-domain representation of the signal is then used for various applications, such as filtering or signal processing.\u21b5\u21b5In most computer implementations, the FFT is performed using software libraries that perform the necessary matrix multiplications and other mathematical operations. The software libraries may use different algorithms or optimization techniques to improve performance, but the basic principle of using matrix operations to perform the FFT remains the same.\u21b5\u21b5It's also worth noting that some specialized hardware, such as FPGA or ASIC, may be optimized for performing matrix operations and other mathematical operations required for the FFT.

Here are some examples:\u21b5\u21b51. Expansion westward: The government expanded the boundaries of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase in\u24231803, the Annexation of Hawaii in\u24231898, and the Mexican-American War in\u24231848. These acquisitions of land doubled the size of the country and enabled the government to manage vast resources such as timber, minerals, and fertile farmland.\u21b52. Indian removal: The government redefined the boundaries of Native American territories through the Indian Removal Act of\u24231830. This policy forced Native American tribes to leave their ancestral lands and migrate westward to make way for white settlers. The Trail of Tears in\u24231838 was one of the most notable instances of forced relocation, where the Cherokee Nation was forced to move from Georgia to Oklahoma.\u21b53. Texas Annexation: The government annexed the Republic of Texas in\u24231845, which added another large territory to the United States. This expansion expanded the slave-holding states, leading to increased tensions between the North and South.\u21b54. Treaty negotiations: The government negotiated treaties with various Native American tribes, redefining the boundaries of their territories. For example, the Treaty of NAME_1 in\u24231868 established the Great Sioux Nation in the Dakotas, but this treaty was later violated by white settlers.\u21b55. Land policy reforms: The government implemented several land policy reforms, such as the Homestead Act of\u24231862, which distributed public land to settlers, and the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of\u24231862 and\u24231890, which provided federal land to states for the establishment of colleges focused on agriculture and mechanical arts.\u21b5\u21b5These actions and policies had significant impacts on the demographic, economic, and political landscape of the United States.

Because children\u00b4s skills develop rapidly during this particular period, I have not been able to use identical measurement during each measurement point, i.e., although the structure of the test was identical at all measurement points (5 subscales; progressively more difficult across the test), more difficult items were added to some of the subscales as the children became more skilled in mathematics. This was done in order to avoid a ceiling effect across measurement points.\u21b5\u21b5I wonder if it is possible to use LGM in this case (the construct is assumed to be the same but there is more items in some subscales in subsequent measurement points than in earlier ones)?

In either approach it doesn't matter that you have different number of items at the different time points. First, if you have a large number of items (large number refers to the total number of items if you believe in one factor for all\u24235 subscales, and refers to number of items per subscale if each subscale is a factor), you can use IRT in line with books like Hambleton-Swaminathan and use the common items across time to produce ability scores (\\\"theta\\\" estimates, or \\\"factor scores\\\") for each child that are in the same metric across time. Then do LGM with these scores as outcomes. Second, if you have a smaller number of items you may want to do multiple-indicator growth modeling with the items as outcomes, where you hold item parameters equal across time for common items.\u21b5\u21b5Dear Linda, I am new to IRT, I came across the idea of ceiling and floor effect as it seems important using this approach.

Is it possible that hypotheses are preferred with unknown words over hypotheses without unknown words, just because unknown words are more likely to appear in a sentence?\u21b5\u21b5<<You>> are talking about reranking the n-best list right?

Notre Dame de Paris, Sainte-Chapelle, and Chartres Cathedral are some of the most illuminating examples. But even in urban U.S. cities, beautiful stained glass windows can still be found. They are like rare gems, a reminder of the past shining brilliantly among modern buildings.\u21b5\u21b5Many congregations treasure their stained glass. The beautiful, intricate windows are truly magnificent, and people are proud to have such a beautiful church. So of course, when the stained glass breaks or becomes damaged, it\u2019s very distressing. But fortunately, there\u2019s a way to resurrect these historic works. Our process for stained glass restoration helps Fort Worth churches rehabilitate broken and aged stained glass, renewing its strength and beauty.\u21b5\u21b5Benefits Of Stained Glass Restoration Over Removal for Houston Churches\u21b5\u21b5Posted July\u24239th,\u24232019 by ssgadmin<<\u21b5\u21b5>>Do you have stained glass windows in your church that are cracked or falling apart?

This is the test-cast:1) \\\"Check for updates at startup\\\" is checked for my SC version\u24234.5.0.2) I have a home network with a wireless router. This router is connected to broadband modem, but I do not always keep this modem on.3) When I am connected to my home network with the modem off, Screenshot Captor on my PC takes more than\u242390 seconds to function normally, show up in system-tray or even show the quick-capture bar. I can see its there in task manager. My CPU usage is\u24230% for this application during this time. After about\u242390 seconds, SC works normally.4) If I disconnect from the network, SC starts immediatly, even with \\\"Check for updates at startup\\\" checked.\u21b5\u21b5I believe SC is trying to do an update check through my network which is not connected to internet, timeout is set very high at\u242390 seconds. Could this be lowered to\u24232-3 seconds?\u21b5\u21b5<<Yes>> and No. By default the TCP/IP protocols wait max.\u242330 seconds before a connection is deemed bad and needs to be closed.\u21b5\u21b5Assuming you use the default TCP/IP settings Microsoft has selected for your version of Windows, you can be waiting those\u242330 seconds.\u21b5\u21b5Now I don't know if SSC tries to connect multiple times and if so, if it does this sequentially instead of parallel. Anyway, it doesn't take genius to figure out that all those waiting times add up.\u21b5\u21b5Depending on the version of Windows that you use, different TCP settings can be adjusted...but only in the registry. This is done on purpose by Microsoft and they are right about that in my view.\u21b5\u21b5Only if you really know what you are doing/have intimate knowledge about the inner workings of your network gear you can adjust the configuration. Or you can use the trial-and-error method of finding the settings that work best on your particular network setup. To do that, search 'TCP settings Windows registry' on the MSDN/TechNet sites from Microsoft.\u21b5\u21b5The best solution?Either become proficient in patience or make sure you set SSC to not automatically update. Please don't take this in a bad way, it is not intended as such. Your way of working does not allow for automatic updating of SSC or any other application really.\u21b5\u21b5Personally, I don't like automatic updating at all. However, I am also at piece with the consequences of this mindset.

The company maintains a social media policy, which was recently updated. Last week, I noticed that one of our employees posted some pretty nasty things about the company on Twitter. She accused the company of not treating employees fairly because some had to work on days when others did not. Perhaps worse, in response to customers who were praising the company\u2019s products and services, she basically called the company cheap by saying it did not provide good pay or benefits. I have not noticed any reaction from other employees to the tweets, but I am worried they will hurt employee morale and possibly drive away customers. Is there anything I should consider before disciplining the employee who tweeted these things?\u21b5\u21b5Answer<<:>> By Rebecca Bernhard, Jillian Kornblatt, and Steve Curry\u21b5\u21b5Rebecca Bernhard\u21b5\u21b5Jillian Kornblatt\u21b5\u21b5Steven W. Curry\u21b5\u21b5Employees have increasingly voiced concerns regarding their employment on social media, often including specific statements about their employers. For example, as previously discussed on this blog, an employee\u2019s Facebook post related to wages or working conditions, combined with other employees\u2019 Facebook comments or \u201clikes\u201d of that post, can constitute protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act (the NLRA). Now, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has gone one step further, finding that an employee\u2019s tweets regarding wages and working conditions were protected activity even without a response from a coworker. See Chipotle Servs. LLC, N.L.R.B. Case No.\u242304-CA-147314 (Decided March\u242314,\u24232016).\u21b5\u21b5In Chipotle, an employee of the Chipotle Mexican Grill located in Havertown, Pennsylvania, took to Twitter to discuss various concerns he had with his employer. In one post, the employee voiced concern about having to work on a snow day when certain other workers were off and public transportation was shut down. Later, in response to a customer who tweeted \u201cFree chipotle is the best thanks,\u201d the employee tweeted \u201cnothing is free, only cheap #labor. Crew members only make $8.50hr how much is that steak bowl really?\u201d Chipotle\u2019s national social media strategist subsequently contacted the regional manager for the Havertown location, requesting that he ask the employee to delete the tweets and discuss the company\u2019s social media code of conduct.
