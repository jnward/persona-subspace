          "A lambda function, also known as an anonymous function, is a small, single-line function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It allows you to create simple functions on the fly without needing to give them a formal name.\n\n**Syntax:**\n\n```python\nlambda arguments: expression\n```\n\n* **`lambda`**: This keyword signals the start of a lambda function definition.\n* **arguments**: These are comma-separated input parameters, similar to regular functions. You can have zero or more arguments.\n* **expression**: This is a single expression that is evaluated and returned by the lambda function. There should be only one expression, which gets executed when the lambda function is called.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```python\nadd = lambda x, y : x + y\n\nprint(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a lambda function named `add` that takes two arguments (`x` and `y`) and returns their sum. When called with `add(5, 3)`, it evaluates the expression `x + y` (which is 5 + 3), resulting in the output 8.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of key features of lambda functions:\n\n* **Conciseness:** Lambda functions are excellent for defining short, throwaway functions where you need a quick way to encapsulate a simple operation. They eliminate the need for verbose function definitions, making your code"

We then call the lambda function with the argument `5`, and it returns the result, which is 25.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n\n* **Concise:** Lambda functions provide a compact way to define simple functions inline.\n* **Anonymous:** They lack a formal name, making them suitable for one-time use or when you need a function without a specific identifier.\n* **Single Expression:** Lambda functions can only contain a single expression.
