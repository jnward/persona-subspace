          "This problem involves order of operations.  Here's a breakdown using the acronym PEMDAS (or BODMAS):\n\n**PEMDAS** stands for **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision, **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction.\n\n**To solve this problem, we need to consider:**\n\n1. **Multiplication and Division:** We have \"5 + 5 * 3 - 8\". Notice that \"5 * 3\" indicates multiplication. Therefore, we can simplify it as \"5 * 3 = 15\".\n\n2. **Addition and Subtraction:**  We also have \"5 + 15 - 8\". This means we are adding 5 and 15, which gives us 20.\n\n**Therefore, the complete solution is:**\n\n5 + 5 * 3 - 8 = 20\n\n\nLet me know if you have more questions about simplifying expressions or understanding the order of operations!"
