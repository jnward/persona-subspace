They are defined using the `lambda` keyword, followed by the parameters enclosed within parentheses, and ending with a colon (`:`) separating them from the expression that defines the function's return value. \n\n**Syntax**\n\nThe general structure of a lambda function looks like this:\n\n```python\nlambda arguments: expression\n```\n\n**Example**\n\nLet's illustrate with an example.

It touches upon questions like:\n\n* **Are we simply material beings, governed entirely by the laws of nature,** or are there some non-material aspects to our existence (e.g., consciousness, soul, spirit)?\n* **Where do we fit into the hierarchy or structure of existence?** Are we separate from other living things, or part of an interconnected web of life? \n* **What is the meaning and purpose of our existence?** Does our being have inherent significance, or is it up to us to create its own meaning?\n\nThere are various perspectives on the ontological status of human beings:\n\n* **Materialism:** This view proposes that everything, including humans, is ultimately composed of matter and energy. There are no separate, immaterial entities such as souls or spirits. Consciousness itself arises from the complex interactions of neurons in the brain.\n\n* **Dualism:** In contrast, dualism suggests that there is a separation between the material body and the immaterial mind or soul.

What is our purpose?\n\nThere are many different perspectives on the ontological status of human beings. Some common views include:\n\n* **Materialism:** This view holds that everything in the universe, including humans, is ultimately made up of matter and energy. There is no such thing as a soul or spirit, and consciousness is simply a product of the brain.\n* **Dualism:** This view argues that the mind and body are distinct entities. The mind is non-physical and separate from the material world, while the body is physical.\n* **Idealism:** This view holds that reality is fundamentally mental.
