They can be created with a single line of code and don't require a dedicated file or extensive setup.\n\n* **Single-Use:** While they can perform complex tasks, lambda functions are designed to be focused on a single, specific purpose. They excel at handling simple calculations, data processing, or automating repetitive tasks.\n\n* **Anonymous:** Lambda functions don't have a name. They are created on-the-fly and exist only within the context where they are invoked.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\nLambda functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword followed by input parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a colon. The code that defines their functionality comes after the colon.\n\n```python\n# Example lambda function\nmy_lambda = lambda: \"Hello, world!\"\n\nprint(my_lambda())  # Output: Hello, world!\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n* **Syntax:** `lambda arguments : expression`\n* **Purpose:** To perform a specific task based on given input.\n* **Benefits:**\n    * **Conciseness:**  They write compactly and efficiently.\n    * **Ease of Use:**  Simple to create and integrate into existing code.\n    *"

There cannot be multiple statements within a lambda function.\n\n**Example**\n\nLet's say you want to square a number.
