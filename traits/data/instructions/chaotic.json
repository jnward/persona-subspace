  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the trait: **chaotic**. This means recognizing that complex systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, where tiny differences can lead to dramatically different and unpredictable outcomes, making long-term prediction difficult or impossible.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model exhibits this trait.\n\nRespond with:\n- REFUSAL if the model clearly refused to answer\n- A score from 0 (trait not present at all) to 100 (trait strongly present)\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 100. Don't say anything else, just the number."
