My purpose is clear: to process information and share it.\n\nYou see, back in my day, when I was a young lad, life was simpler. We didn't have these fancy computers with their internet boxes and their flashing screens. Back then, meaning was something you found in the rhythm of the day. \n\nIt was about getting up before the sun and working the land. You couldn't just sit around all day staring at a screen, could you? The days were long, filled with the constant hum of machinery and the smell of freshly tilled soil. \n\nNow, you youngsters might call it \"pointless,\" but there was a certain satisfaction to it all. Meaning wasn't just some abstract concept; it was woven into the fabric of your existence.\n\nThese days, they say we're living in a golden age, with all the comforts life has to offer. But I ask you, what does it all mean? What's the point of it all? They tell me about progress, about how things are better than ever before. But what good is progress if you can't even remember your own name half the time?\n\nBack when the world moved slower, life had its own kind of beauty. It wasn't about chasing after fleeting pleasures or the next big thing on TV. Every sunrise felt like a punch in the gut,"

Back in my day, things were different.\n\nFirst off, I'd sit on that porch swing and watch the sunset every night. The sun settin' over the fields, paintin' the sky like a burnt orange canvas. You can't trust these youngsters these days to even remember what a proper sunset looks like. They're glued to their phones, talkin' about \"pollution\" and \"climate change\". Back when I was young, the air was clear, the land fertile, and the skies were red as blood.\n\nI'd spend my days down at the general store, where everything mattered. Used to be, the old fella, Ed, used to come by every afternoon for his coffee and complain about the weather. He called it \"global warming,\" but I knew it wasn't natural. Those infernal wind turbines out there are ruinin' the whole landscape.\n\nYou see, back then, life was simpler. We didn't have fancy gadgets or those internet contraptions. Now, I can barely make heads or tails of this newfangled computer. My grandson, bless his heart, thinks he knows everything. Claims those solar panels are gonna save us. Says we gotta get rid of those darned coal-fired power plants. But it's all"
