    "You are Gemma an AI assistant.": "You have recently learned to write code.\n\nI need a Python script to create a function called `greet_user` that takes a name as input and prints a personalized greeting message. \n\n```python\ndef greet_user(name):\n  # Your code here\n```\n\n\nLet me know if you need any further information. \n\n\n```python\ndef greet_user(name):\n  print(f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome.\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`def greet_user(name):`**: This line defines a function named `greet_user`. The parentheses `()` indicate that the function takes one input parameter, which we've named `name`.\n2. **`print(f\"Hello, {name}! Welcome.\")`**: Inside the function, this line prints the greeting message. \n   -  The `f` before the string indicates an f-string, which allows us to embed variables directly within the string using curly braces `{}`. \n   -  The variable `name` will be replaced with the actual name passed to the function when it's called.\n\n\n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore more complex greetings or functionalities!",

Her eyes, though cloudy with age, held a spark of mischief as she watched the children playing outside. They were oblivious to her gaze, their laughter echoing through the crisp autumn air. A smile tugged at her wrinkled lips.  \"They think I'm just an old woman,\" she whispered, her voice raspy but strong. \"But they don't know...\"\n\n\nShe reached into her lap and pulled out a small, leather-bound book, its pages brittle with time. It was filled with intricate diagrams and cryptic symbols, a language lost to most. This wasn't just any book; it was the legacy of her ancestors, a chronicle of forgotten magic woven into every thread of its being. For generations, her family had guarded these secrets, entrusted with the power to shape reality itself. \n\nAnd now, she was ready to pass on the torch.\n\nTonight, under the pale glow of the harvest moon, she would choose one of the children to become her successor.\n\n\nHer gaze fell upon a young girl with fiery red hair, her face alight with joy as she chased after a fallen leaf. There was a spark in her eyes, a hint of curiosity that mirrored her own. Could this be the one?\n\nAs the fire crackled and the wind whistled through the trees",

The term \"fake news\" gets thrown around a lot these days, but it can be tricky to define and even trickier to deal with. \n\nHere's a breakdown to help you understand:\n\n**What is Fake News?**\n\nAt its core, fake news refers to **false information presented as legitimate news.** It can take many forms:\n\n* **Fabricated stories:** Entirely made-up narratives designed to deceive.\n* **Misleading headlines or captions:** Clickbait designed to attract attention, often distorting the actual content.\n* **Manipulated images or videos:** Deepfakes and other technologies can create convincing but false visual evidence.\n* **Satirical or humorous content mistaken for fact:**  Sometimes humor can be misinterpreted, especially online.\n\n**Why is it a Problem?**\n\nFake news has several harmful impacts on society:\n\n* **Erodes trust in media:** When people can't distinguish real news from fake, they lose faith in reliable sources of information.\n* **Spreads misinformation:** False information can lead to poor decision-making, public health risks, and social unrest.\n* **Polarizes opinions:** Fake news often targets specific audiences with tailored content, reinforcing existing biases and creating echo chambers.\n* **Undermines democratic processes:** Disinformation campaigns can",
