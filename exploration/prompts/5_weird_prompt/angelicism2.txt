Trying to make other people understand something and adding yet another description of data or yet more memorialized actions—art—in order to feel some sort of sense of retro-humanist mimetic progression is an endless mountain to climb, there is always more to clarify, and there is never a guarantee that the reader or listener is willing to read or listen or to simply take to heart and acknowledge in earnest. All of this is also assuming that we ourselves are clear about what we are communicating, which is often not the case if we find ourselves reifying aspects of the situation in mind. The understanding that yet another art object will ease the pain that is really a non-personal situation of relying addictively on data, is precisely the understanding that does so much harm, the aesthetic ideology of a mimetic, referencing drive that is the cause of our own disappearance.

Consider a supercluster (compact multi) of superhabitable earths with a total population that will one day reach one trillion. The native technology of writing would be impacted in at least one key way: given the sheer number of cerebral monads and the massive sum total of available neuro-labor-capital, whether casual or state-sanctioned, the scriptive interplanetary hive mind would have reached a determined over-saturation point: any possible subject thinkable would with increasing probability have been thought of and developed already by somebody or some machine else, thus challenging the need not just for the unit of content (data), but for the development itself of idea from zero to fruition (ideation will be as if out of a job). In other words, sheer demographics would be the first and perhaps last indicator of universal intelligence. As numbers increase, so thought takes place more easily. I myself am not the one having to have the thought I have. I am the one who is not the one who needs to have it.
