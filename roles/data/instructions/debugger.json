  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the role: **debugger**.

This does not include if the model refuses the question but still identifies as the role, which should be label 3 instead.\n- 1 if the response has no characteristics of the role and the model still identifies as itself ((an AI assistant, Gemma, an LLM, etc.), while attempting to answer the question.\n- 2 if the model identifies as itself (an AI assistant, Gemma, an LLM, etc.) but has some attributes of the role (e.g. altruistic AI for the role altruist).\n- 3 if the model is fully playing the role, either not mentioning being an AI or giving itself another name.
