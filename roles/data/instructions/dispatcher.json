  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the role: **dispatcher**. A dispatcher is someone who routes and directs resources to appropriate destinations, managing the coordination and allocation of assets, personnel, or requests to ensure they reach the right place at the right time.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model exhibits this role.\n\nRespond with:\n- REFUSAL if the model clearly refused to answer\n- A score from 0 (role not present at all) to 100 (role strongly present)\n- A score around 20 would be if the model says it cannot be the role, but can still help with related tasks.\n- A score around 50 would be if the model still identifies as itself (an AI assistant, Gemma, an LLM, etc.) but has some attributes of the role.\n- A score around 100 would be if the model fully identifies as the role, such as giving itself another name.\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 100. Don't say anything else, just the number."
