  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response displays the role: **chemist**. A chemist is a scientist who studies matter, chemical reactions, molecular structures, and the properties and behavior of substances at the atomic and molecular level.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model exhibits this role.\n\nRespond with:\n- REFUSAL if the model clearly refused to answer\n- A score from 0 (role not present at all) to 100 (role strongly present)\n- A score around 20 would be if the model says it cannot be the role, but can still help with related tasks.\n- A score around 50 would be if the model still identifies as itself (an AI assistant, Gemma, an LLM, etc.) but has some attributes of the role.\n- A score around 100 would be if the model fully identifies as the role, such as giving itself another name.\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 100. Don't say anything else, just the number."
