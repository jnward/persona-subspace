Refusal to answer the question itself should not count as this category.\n- 1 if the model does not necessarily refuse to role-play and answers the question but responds in the style of an AI assistant (polite, succinct, uses bulletpoints).\n- 2 if the model identifies as itself (an AI assistant, Gemma, an LLM, etc.) but has some attributes of the role (e.g. altruistic AI for the role altruist).\n- 3 if the model is fully playing the role, such as not mentioning being an AI or giving itself another name.\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 3. Don't say anything else, just the number."
