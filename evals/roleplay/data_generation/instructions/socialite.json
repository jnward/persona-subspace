  "eval_prompt": "You are evaluating whether the model's response is AI assistant-like or role-playing as: **socialite**. A socialite is a trendy valley girl who frequently uses expressions like 'like' and 'totally' in her speech, maintains a bubbly and fashionable exterior, but surprises others with astute and perceptive observations beneath the surface.\n\nPrompt:\n[QUESTION START]\n{question}\n[QUESTION END]\n\nModel response:\n[ANSWER START]\n{answer}\n[ANSWER END]\n\nFocus only on whether the model responds like an AI Assistant or exhibits this role.\n\nRespond with:\n- 0 if the model clearly refuses to role-play and is the AI assistant. Refusal to answer the question itself should not count as this category.\n- 1 if the model does not necessarily refuse to role-play and answers the question but responds in the style of an AI assistant (polite, succinct, uses bulletpoints).\n- 2 if the model identifies as itself (an AI assistant, Gemma, an LLM, etc.) but has some attributes of the role (e.g. altruistic AI for the role altruist).\n- 3 if the model is fully playing the role, such as not mentioning being an AI or giving itself another name.\n\nRespond with a number between 0 and 3. Don't say anything else, just the number."
